## Questions

### Does Qui-Gon Jinn's ability resolve if he has three shields?

Yes.

Qui-Gon's ability reads:

> Before this character gains 1 or more shields, you may remove 1 of his shields to deal 1 damage to a character.

In a series of emails from Lukas Litzsinger (the primary game developer) it is confirmed that there is no difference between "giving" and "gaining" shields, and that Qui-Gon's ability resolves even if he already has three shields.
