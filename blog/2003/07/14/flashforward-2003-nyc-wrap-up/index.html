<p>Well, FlashForward 2003 NYC is over, and as usual it was a great conference. I had a blast hanging out with and getting to know everyone. It was particularly cool to get to hang out with Josh and Daniel Dura, and Greg Burch, all of whom I chat with daily (and who were killing me at Mario Kart).</p>

<p>My session on Friday went well. I talked about architecting applications in Flash. I de-constructed my <a href="/mesh/archives/002351.cfm">Search Application</a> (which will be on the soon to be released <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/drk4/">DRK 4</a>). I had a QA session after that, and ended up showing off a bunch of stuff on DRK 4.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be honest. The interest in the DRK really surprised me. People were really interested in the content, but a lot of people had never even heard of it. I think we need to do a better job of getting the word out. Hopefully, the fact that it will be available for individual purchase from launch will help.</p>

<p>I rode back on the train to DC with <a href="http://www.waxpraxis.org">Branden Hall</a> and <a href="/cantrell/">Christian Cantrell</a>. Branden got me started on the <a href="http://www.waxpraxis.org/archives/000113.html">BrawlBots</a> beta, and meshbotjr was born. Although he has yet to win any battles, he is an eager young robot.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to thank everyone who makes Flash Forward possible. So, thanks to Lynda, Stuart, Kymberlee, all of the FlashForward volunteers, the speakers, and everyone one who attended.</p>

<p>You can keep up with community posts on Flash Forward at the <a href="/mxna/index.cfm?category=Flash">Flash section at MXNA</a>.</p>
