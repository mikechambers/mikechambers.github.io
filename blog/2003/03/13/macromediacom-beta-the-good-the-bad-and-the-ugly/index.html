			<h2>Macromedia.com Beta : The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</h2>
<p class="meta">Thursday, March 13, 2003</p>

<div class="post">
<p>We launched our new website site last week, and as I am sure most people in the community know, it generated quite a lot of discussion. Well, we were listening. We took the feedback (from the community, survey, feedback forms, and talking to directly to users), tweaked the site, and have released <a href="http://www.macromedia.com">a new version of the website</a>. The new home page is a hybrid site combining HTML and Flash, has a more straight forward navigation scheme, and loads much quicker now.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/d65home_betamod_contenthead"><img src="http://www.macromedia.com/special/progress_report/images/chart3.gif" align="center" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>We learned a ton of things from the first week of the beta, and while everything didn&#8217;t work out as we had planned, we decided the information was too valuable to keep to ourselves. We have put together a <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/d65home_betamod_contenthead">report about what we learned from the first stage of the beta</a>. The report outlines what worked (the exchanges) and what didn&#8217;t (the home page), and provides detailed information, statistics and survey results about the website&#8217;s first week.</p>

<p>You can view the report <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/d65home_betamod_contenthead">here</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the interesting info you can find from the report:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Connection speed did not influence how people rated their experience on the site.</li>
<li>  Processor speed did influence how people rated the site.</li>
<li>  The number of downloads on the exchange doubled.</li>
<li>  Customer satisfaction for the Rich Internet Applications on the site were generally high.</li>
<li>  Very few users used any of the advanced navigation on the home page (less than 5%).</li>
</ul>

<p>Is the new site perfect? Not yet. We are still working on improving it. If you have any comments or suggestions, let us know about them through the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/bin/webfeedback.cgi">feedback form</a>, and / or <a href="http://www.infopoll.net/live/surveys/s21142.htm">survey</a>.</p>
