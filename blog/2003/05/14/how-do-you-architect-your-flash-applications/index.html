          <h2>How do you Architect your Flash Applications?</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>I have once again been doing a lot of application development with Flash, and have begun to create some more advanced apps / functionality. Previously, I would follow a few simple rules to organize my applications:<br>
&lt;!--more--&gt;</p>

<ul>
<li>  Use only one frame of main timeline.</li>
<li>  All code on main timeline</li>
<li>  Classes and function libraries moved to external ActionScript files</li>
<li>  UI Event handlers included in FLA</li>
</ul>

<p>This actually worked well for applications which only had one state (such as the <a href="http://www.markme.com/mesh/archives/000775.cfm">Stock Services app</a>), but did not work well for more complex applications which had multiple states / screens.</p>

<p>When I started working on the <a href="http://www.markme.com/mesh/archives/002351.cfm">GoogleSearch application</a> I knew that it would have multiple screens (one for search, one for settings, and one for about information). I looked at the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/drk/productinfo/product_overview/volume3/sample_apps.html">RSSify application</a> (created by <a href="http://www.gregburch.com">Greg Burch</a>) included on <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/drk/productinfo/product_overview/volume3/">DRK 3</a> which has a similar structure (although much more complex functionality).</p>

<p>I ended up doing the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Create a base class contained within a symbol. All events and data flow through this class.</li>
<li>  Create Screen Classes and symbols for each screen. They communicate by broadcasting events.</li>
<li>  Virtually everything is contained within a class, and thus all ActionScript is externalized in external ActionScript files.</li>
<li>  There is no code on the main timeline.</li>
<li>  There is code in multiple symbols</li>
</ul>

<p>This has actually worked out very well. I was worried that I would have trouble finding where the code was located, but I found that structuring my library made it even easier to work on and find the code:</p>

<p>My library basically became an ActionScript class browser.</p>

<p>All of my ActionScript classes are in external files (based on classes), so it is very easy for me to find and move between code.</p>

<p><img alt="google_class.gif" src="/mesh/images/google_class.gif" width="514" height="286" border="0" /></p>

<p>The main issue I ran into was loading order (init clip). I ran into a couple of problems where I would try to access code that was not loaded yet. I solved this by having my screens broadcast onLoad events, that the main app class would listen for.</p>

<p>Anyways, how do you architect your movies? Have you run into limits with placing all of your code in one place? What do you think the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/flash/whitepapers/actionscript_standards.pdf">best practice</a> should be?</p>
