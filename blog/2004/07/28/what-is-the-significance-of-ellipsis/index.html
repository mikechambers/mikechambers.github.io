          <h2>What is the Significance of Ellipsis?</h2>
<p class="meta">Wednesday, July 28, 2004</p>

<div class="post">
<p>As you probably know by now, we just released an <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/special/7_2updater/">update to Flash MX 2004</a>. Code-named Ellipsis, this brings Flash up to version 7.2 and <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flash/mx2004/releasenotes.html">addresses a ton of issues</a>.</p>

<p>Thus far, everyone seems to be pretty excited about the update and all its changes. Some users are still a little skeptical, or unhappy that a particular bug was not fixed, and we completely understand that. We know it will take time to win back everyone&#8217;s trust, and Ellipsis is just one step in that process.</p>

<p>While I think Ellipsis as an update to Flash is huge, I think it takes on an even greater significance when you look at it in the context of other things that have been going on at Macromedia and on the Flash team. I wrote an <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/flash/articles/context.html">article</a> on just this subject, and if you have the time, I highly recommend reading it. Hopefully it will help give a glimpse into how we are thinking of things, how Ellipsis fits into the context of all of the recent changes, and how it relates to 8Ball (next full version of Flash).</p>

<p>Here is the link to the article:</p>
