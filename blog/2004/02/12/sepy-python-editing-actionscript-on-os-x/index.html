          <h2>SE|PY : Python : Editing ActionScript on OS X</h2>
<p class="meta">Thursday, February 12, 2004</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I made the switch from Windows to OS X about 3 months ago. I have absolutely loved it and have not had any problems except for one thing. I have not been able to find a good editor to write ActionScript code.</p>

<p>I had been using <a href="http://www.jedit.org">JEdit</a>, but it is a little to slow and a little too Java for my liking. The other night, I came across the <a href="http://www.sephiroth.it/python/sepy.php?column=0">SE|PY editor project</a>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This is an ActionScript editor written in <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> that has an impressive array of features specific to ActionScript. You can download the binaries for Windows, but as of yet there is no support for OS X.</p>

<p>A couple of developers have worked to get it running on OS X, and have had some success. It appears that a lot of the issues simply have to do with path issues (due to differences between Windows and OS X).</p>

<p>So, I downloaded the source, took a crash corse in Python, and began hacking away (all today). To my surprise, I actually got it to run and load an ActionScript file.</p>

</div>

<p>It is still not usable, but it has definitely raised my spirits. So, if you know Python, use a Mac, and want to help get the editor running, head over to the project&#8217;s site and sign up.</p>

<p>Btw, here is the change I made to WindowsProjects.py to get it to run (added this else to the first if / else statement):</p>

<pre>else:
        ico = wxIcon(os.path.normpath('%s/icons/%s.ico' % (path, 'file')),wxBITMAP_TYPE_ICO,16,16)
</pre>

<p>You can find more info on SE|PY <a href="http://www.sephiroth.it/python/sepy.php?column=0">here</a>.</p>
