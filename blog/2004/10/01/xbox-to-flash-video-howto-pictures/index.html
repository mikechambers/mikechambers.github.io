<div class="post">
<p>As I posted yesterday, we did a little test that involved streaming video from an <a href="http://www.xbox.com">Xbox</a> (playing <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/starwarsbattlefront/default.htm?level3=starwarsbattlefront&amp;level2=fg5blurb&amp;level1=enusgames">StarWars Battlefront</a>) over <a href="http://www.markme.com/mesh/archives/004319.cfm">DevChat</a> via <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/flash/video.html">Flash video</a>. I actually did <a href="http://www.markme.com/mesh/archives/000360.cfm">something similar</a> to this about a year ago, but this was to help test a new (and hopefully better) hardware configuration.</p>

<p>A lot of people were asking how we did it, so I thought I would make a quick post explaining it.</p>

<p>Here is the setup:<br>
&lt;!--more--&gt;</p>

<p><img alt="xbox_flow_.gif" src="/mesh/files/xbox_test/xbox_flow_.gif" width="389" height="392" border="0" /></p>

<p>Xbox connects to the <a href="http://www.canopus.com/US/products/advc-100/pm_advc-100.asp">Canopus ADVC 100</a>. This is a box that takes video in via a number of different connections, and allows you to split it out via a number of connections. We used an RCA cable to connect the Xbox to the ADVC 100. We could have also use an S-Video cable, which would have given us better picture quality, but we did not have one handy. </p>

<p>The ADVC 100 splits the connection. One connection goes via RCA cable to a <a href="http://www.viewsonic.com/products/tventertainment/tvvideoprocessors/nextvisionn4/">Viewsonic N4</a>. This is a nice little box that converts video in the VGA signals. The main reason we needed this is so that we could play the game on a monitor (in this case a 42 inch Plasma), which we connect with via a VGA cable. Ideally we would have connected directly to the plasma screen from the ADVC 100 with an SVideo cable, but we didn&#8217;t have an S-Video cable handy, and thus had to connect through the AV connections (VGA) in the conference room.</p>

<p>The other connection from the ADVC 100 connects to a Mac Powerbook (1.25 ghz, 1 gig ram) via Firewire.</p>

<p>Finally, we had a simple audio connection from the ADVC 100 to the conference rooms audio system.</p>

<p>This setup allows us to view / play on the plasma while at the same time making the video available to the Powerbook.</p>

<p>For this test, we opened up DevChat on the powerbook, selected the video pod, and created a video and audio stream. We just had to tell the Flash / Central player to use the Digital Video (DV) feed via Firewire as the audio and video source. Danny Dura posted a screen shot of it <a href="http://www.danieldura.com/archives/rants_and_raves/watch_star_wars_battlefront_in_devchat.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, we could also open some video editing software (such as iMovie) and save the DV stream. That is a post for another day though. </p>

<p>Here are a couple of pictures of the setup. Sorry that they are a little blurry, but they were taken with a couple of cell phones (my <a href="http://commerce.motorola.com/consumer/QWhtml/m_v600.html">Motorola v600</a> and <a href="/cantrell/">Christian&#8217;s</a> new <a href="http://www.danger.com/consumers_hiptop2.php">Sidekick II</a>):</p>

<p><img alt="xbox_2_.jpg" src="/mesh/files/xbox_test/xbox_2_.jpg" width="640" height="480" border="0" /></p>

<p><img alt="xbox_3_.jpg" src="/mesh/files/xbox_test/xbox_3_.jpg" width="602" height="393" border="0" /></p>

<p>We learned a couple of things:</p>

<ul>
<li>  The hardware setup works</li>
<li>  We need to use higher quality cables (S-Video) for the connections. Video quality noticeable suffered do to the lower quality cables, and the length of the cables.</li>
<li>  Danny needs to learn to aim in Battlefront</li>
</ul>

<p>This was just simple test to check out the hardware configuration. We are working on some other things which should be pretty cool. More info on that in the future.</p>
