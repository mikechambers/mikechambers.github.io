			<h2>Where is the Flash Player 8.5 Alpha Download?</h2>
<p class="meta">Tuesday, October 18, 2005</p>

<div class="post">
<p>As you probably know, we launched <a href="http://labs.macromedia.com/">Macromedia Labs</a> yesterday by <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/labs_flex2_downloads">releasing</a> alpha versions of Flex Builder 2, Flex Framework 2 and Flash Player 8.5. However, there has been some questions and confusion over where the Flash Player download is.</p>

<p>The Flash Player installers for both Mac and Windows are included within the Flex Builder <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/labs_flex2_downloads">downloads</a>. If you are on Windows and are installing the standalone version of Flex Builder, the installer will prompt you to install the players.<br>
&lt;!--more--&gt;</p>

<p>If you are on Mac, then you can get the installers by <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/labs_flex2_downloads">downloading</a> the Flex Builder 2 Eclipse plugin zip file. The installers are located within the Zip file.</p>

<p>Standalone players are included in both Flex Builder installs (standalone and plugin).</p>

<p>So, why did we make it so difficult to find and install the player?</p>

<p>Well, there was a rather heated discussion about this internally at Macromedia. There was a concern that since this is an alpha quality player, that there were probably some compatibility issues that we did not know about, and there were concerns about developer / user backlash if existing content stopped working. Because of this, the decision was made to not have direct downloads of the player installer at launch.</p>

<p>We are considering making direct download of the alpha player available (via the labs site) in the near future. </p>

<p>This would still only be available behind the labs login (open to anyone). Any thoughts on this?</p>
