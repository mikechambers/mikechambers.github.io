			<h2>Open Source Flex and its impact on Apollo</h2>
<p class="meta">Thursday, April 26, 2007</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Well, as I am sure you have heard by now, we <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200704/042607Flex.html">announced last night that we will be releasing the Flex Framework and SDK under the open source Mozilla Public License (MPL)</a>. I am not going to go into too much details on the announcement, as it is covered in depth everywhere else (<a href="http://www.onflex.org/ted/2007/04/flex-goes-open-source-mpl.php">Ted Patrick has a post </a>with a good over view and collection of links, and Robert Scoble has posted some videos about the news (<a href="http://www.podtech.net/home/scobleshow/2826/breaking-news-adobe-flash-flex-goes-open-sourc">1</a> and <a href="http://www.podtech.net/home/scobleshow/2826/breaking-news-adobe-flash-flex-goes-open-sourc">2</a>)).</p>

<p>One of the things included as part of this announcement is that all of the Flex based <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/apollo">Apollo</a> components will also be open sourced, but that then begs the question, what about the rest of the content that will be included within the Apollo SDK. </p>

<p>We haven&#8217;t announced any plans at this time to open source the Apollo SDK. We are still in our alpha / beta development stage, and thus we don&#8217;t even know for sure what all will be within the SDK. However, once we have a better picture of what the final SDK will include, then I don&#8217;t think it is unreasonable to expect that the Apollo SDK, or parts of it, will follow the same path of the Flex SDK, especially since they are so tightly integrated.</p>

<p>Expect to hear more on this over the next couple of months as the Apollo release begins to solidify.</p>
