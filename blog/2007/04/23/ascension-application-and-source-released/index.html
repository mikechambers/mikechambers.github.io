			<h2>Ascension Application and Source Released</h2>
<p class="meta">Monday, April 23, 2007</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Well, I know it took forever, but I have finally released the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ascensionplayer/">source and an AIR file for Ascension</a>, an <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/apollo">Apollo</a> based mp3 player and music explorer. You can download the latest AIR file, as well as grab the source, log bugs, and discuss the player from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ascensionplayer/">Ascension project page at Google Code</a>.</p>

<p>All of the source is included, and is released under an open source license.<br>
&lt;!--more--&gt;</p>

<p>I am sorry it took so long to release, but I am usually reluctant to release source code that I feel needs more work. Ascension was one of the first Apollo applications, and as such, has under gone a lot of changes since I first built it. Because of this, the code does need some refactoring, but I figured that in general, it was more valuable to everyone if I released the source now.</p>

<p>If you are interested working on the Ascension project, then please join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ascensionplayer">Ascension mailing list</a>. There is a lot of work that needs to be done, including refactoring, adding direct mp3 support, new windowing modes, new design, and writing documentation.</p>

<p>If you run into any bugs, or have feature requests, please make sure to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ascensionplayer/issues/list">log them</a>.</p>
