<div class="post">
<p>I was bummed to read Dave Winer&#8217;s <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/04/30#leffd1417f9d54d0f39383bf409d9f8b5">comments</a> about Macromedia&#8217;s position<br>
vis a vis &#8220;BigCo&#8217;s&#8221;.&nbsp; The two primary issues &#8212; the mass community of<br>
scripting-level developers, and Macromedia&#8217;s efforts around web services<br>
interoperability &#8212; actually underscore a philosophy that I think is<br>
shared by Macromedia and Dave, and which is actually quite the opposite<br>
of BigCo-obsessing.<br>
The point about scripting-level developers is simple:&nbsp; the vast majority<br>
of people building web applications are using scripting languages, not<br>
big enterprise architectures; a huge number are using VBScript/Jscript<br>
in ASP; lots of use ColdFusion; tons use PHP, some Perl, some Python,<br>
and on and on.&nbsp; This is a good thing.&nbsp; Scripting is pragmatic and<br>
cost-effective.&nbsp; Our mission with MX is to empower these people.&nbsp; I&#8217;m<br>
not sure how this is paying homage to BigCo&#8217;s.<br>
The second item, on my comments on working with Microsoft on web<br>
services interoperability was merely a matter of fact.&nbsp; Yes, people<br>
(unfortunately) equate web services with .NET, and its important as a<br>
vendor to convey support for the same standards Microsoft is supporting.<br>
However, it&#8217;s also worth noting that Microsoft has been incredibly<br>
active and supportive of efforts to drive interoperabiity, along with<br>
dozens of others in the community.&nbsp; The related comment was about our<br>
approach here, which is decidely not BigCo &#8212; we&#8217;ve been actively<br>
contributing to the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis/">Apache Axis project</a>, an open source platform for web<br>
services.&nbsp; We&#8217;re working with the community at large to help make this<br>
all a reality.<br>
