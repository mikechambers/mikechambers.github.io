<p>Video in Flash MX.<br>
&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;&nbsp;Danny Mavromatis and Mike Davidson, ESPN.com</p>

<p>Danny and Mike work for ESPN.com which is a very popular site. they do have some power to force users to change browsers.<br>
Video in Flash<br>
<strong>Image Sequences</strong><br>
Most primitive version of video in flash is a sequence of images. They are showing some Seinfeld clips that use the technique. Basically, take a video clip, export it as a sequence of images, and then import them into flash (flash will recornize that it is a sequence of images).<br>
problems, no sound, although you can manually add it. it is essentially an image of jpgs. no temporal compression.<br>
<strong>QuickTime</strong><br>
Flash Player is embedded in player. Pretty much flash 4 compatible, but can be a little buggy. more for adding effects on top of quicktime movies.<br>
<strong>Video on Top of Flash</strong><br>
Interface in Flash, and then layer video ontop of flash using DHTML and iframes. Works pretty well. problems with browser support (due to DHTML).<br>
The Importance of Flash MX Video  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Reduces incompatibilities between systems (some difference between playback on pc and mac, pc smoother).  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Reduces complexities of mcahine interactions.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Easier to set up on the client.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>More self-contained  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Not easiliy saveable on client-machines  </p>

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>

<p>on mac, import an 1/8 of a second&nbsp; blank audio on first frame. set it to stream. this will make the video drop frames if it can&#8217;t keep up, which leads to better video flow.<br>
Showing new ESPN video player. Flash Interface, with a layer of video (real or windows media) over flash. sometimes it will not come up, can take a while to load due to checking players, browser, etc...<br>
Showing Xgames video full screen flash application / projector, with video. *Pretty sweet &#8211; mc*.<br>
It is more difficult to steal video from Flash. That doesn&#8217;t mean it is impossible, but for regular users, it is enough of a hassle, that most will give up or not try.<br>
Because everything is contained within Flash, you can leverage the power of flash with video to completely customize your application (i.e. create a custom / advanced preloader for the video).<br>
more advantages to video in flash<br>
*   no missing codec issues.<br>
    *   fully transparent display mechanism<br>
        *   temporal compression (only saves video data that changes from flash to flash. sorenson squeeze does this and leads to higher quality and lower file sizes).<br>
            *   easily operable across flash applicaiotns.<br>
                *   potential on playback on devices.</UL></p>

<a name="line-2"></a>
<a name="line-3"></a>            *   currently not batch encodable (sorenson spark pro can do this).  
<a name="line-4"></a>                *   No built in buffering mechanisms (you can write your own buffering with ActionScript).  
<a name="line-5"></a>                    *   No built in connection speed detection mchanisms.  
<a name="line-6"></a>                        *   No sure streamtype capabilities.  
<a name="line-7"></a>                            *   Current Flash 6 player pentration is low.&lt;/UL&gt;
<a name="line-8"></a>
<a name="line-9"></a>                            they are showing media metrix numbers for flash penetration. numbers are from march. they are very consistent in growth rates. every 14 months, pentration is up to 86% (based on his research. *note, we project flash 6 rates will go up faster than in the past. -mc*)  
<a name="line-10"></a>
<a name="line-11"></a>                            *   Video does not automatically stop on last frame (you can write actionscript to stop it).  
<a name="line-12"></a>                                *   upsacing video size is slightly inferior to other video formats.  
<a name="line-13"></a>                                    *   not a reference format (quicktime is, windows media, real are not).  
<a name="line-14"></a>                                        *   no rights managements capabilities.  
<a name="line-15"></a>                                            *   No native full screen mode. &lt;/UL&gt;
<a name="line-16"></a>
<a name="line-17"></a>                                            end of session.&lt;/p&gt;
