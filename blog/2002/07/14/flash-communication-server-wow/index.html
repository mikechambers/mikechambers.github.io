          <h2>Flash Communication Server : Wow!</h2>
<p class="meta">Sunday, July 14, 2002</p>

<div class="post">
<p>(Note, I am posting this first as a Flash Developer excited about the technology, and second as a Macromedia employee).<br>
I haven&#8217;t had much time to play around with the Flash Communication Server. I have been focusing on Flash Remoting, and working on a book on the same subject. However, last night I finally got a chance to install the server and play around. Here is the timeline:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>0 minutes : begin installing server.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>5 minutes : server installed.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>10 minutes : I have created a simple multiuser chat application, where users log it, the user&#8217;s names are displayed, and they can chat with each other.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>20 minutes : After playing around with the chat, I add audio and video support. It works pretty well with two video streams over my measly 144/144 DSL connection.  </p>

<ul>
<li>  25 minutes : I add a shared whiteboard, and cursors (you see everyone else&#8217;s cursor (we had some bug fights)). Works like a charm, although the whiteboard takes focus away from the chat sometime.</UL></li>
</ul>

<p>So in 25 minutes I had created an app which allowed multiple users to connect and chat, send and receive video, share cursors, and work together on a whiteboard. All of this, and this is the kicker, without writing a single line of ActionScript. You can see a <a href="/mesh/picts/flashcom_chat.html">picture of the chat</a> with video support here with myself, Christian Cantrell and Phillip Torrone all chatting(I am not sure why I didn&#8217;t just take a screen shot).<br>
So now, I have to go back to not sleeping so I can play around with this and Flash Remoting. Btw, I am hoping to get some content up on the site here soon. Maybe we will have some live chats or something (post any ideas you might have in the comments section).</p></p></li>
