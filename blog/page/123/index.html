  <div class="entry-content"><p>I came in a little late.<br/>
orangedesign created the menus for lucasart&#8217;s starfighter games (2) for ps2. All of the menus were created within macromedia flash, and played back within a Flash player included with the game.<br/>
Have to conisder localization. They do the German version first since the german words tend to be the longest.<br/>
Memory considerations, only 32 megs of ram on ps2. compressed sizes of images doesn&#8217;t matter, it is the uncompressed size. reducing the number of colors. the butterflyed the images (symetrical, so they only have to load half of each image (and then flip it)).<br/>
design process<br/>
fred is showing some of the images they presented to the lucas arts to get an idea of the type of imagery they were looking for in the jedi starfigter menus. (just regular images they found on the web).<br/>
originally, they had a more dirty, mechaninal interface, but in the end it became more modern, clean look.<br/>
showed series of drawings of early menu prototypes. really cool.<br/>
tips and tricks<br/>
memory issues</p>

<ul>
<li>use ntsc or pal on a television to determine how far you can compress bitmaps.

<ul>
<li>watch memory. major issue.

<ul>
<li>butterfly symetrical bitmaps whenever possible.

<ul>
<li>concern yourself with the unpacked size of images, not the file size.

<ul>
<li>Optimize your bitmaps before they are brough in.</UL></li>
</ul>


<p>framerate issues</p>

<ul>
<li>try breaking text if it doesnt animate fast enough.

<ul>
<li>avoid using more that a paragraph of type on one screen.

<ul>
<li>build all of your alpha effects into your bitmaps.

<ul>
<li>give life to your art by animating smaller screen areas.

<ul>
<li>with vectors, try finding shapes that use the fewsest number of triangles.

<ul>
<li>don&#8217;t use a lot of thin vector lines.</UL></li>
</ul>


<p>Localization</p>

<ul>
<li>design with plenty of space for copy. 150%.

<ul>
<li>localize early in german (long words, design issues)

<ul>
<li>test doubel byte comparison.

<ul>
<li>work with native speaker to avoid embarressment.

<ul>
<li>have experienced designer do the final layout.</UL></li>
</ul>


<p>Sony Requirements</p>

<ul>
<li>memory cards stuff is more than half of the work. (what happens when the user pulls a card out, inserts it, etc&hellip;).

<ul>
<li>sony design documentation manual. very big.</UL></li>
</ul>


<p>card issues, example:</p>

<ul>
<li>is card full

<ul>
<li>formatted?

<ul>
<li>saved data?

<ul>
<li>ps2 card or ps1?

<ul>
<li>damage?

<ul>
<li>is it being formatted?

<ul>
<li>being read?

<ul>
<li>did you tell the user how much space is required?

<ul>
<li>does the user want to format or save the data?

<ul>
<li>etc&hellip;</UL></li>
</ul>


<p>these all have to be asked and considered within the flash movie.<br/>
Middleware layer. the layer of scripting between the hardware / game and flash.</p>

<ul>
<li>written by game programmer.

<ul>
<li>a simple script layer

<ul>
<li>communicates between game, flash and hardware.

<ul>
<li>almost all UI logic resideds in the flash later.

<ul>
<li>middleware never drives the flash movie.</UL></li>
</ul>


<p>example of setting something in the game&#8217;s middleware. this tells the game to play in stereo mode:
<PRE>getURL(&#8220;callback://SetStereoStatus&#8221;, 2);</PRE></p>

<p>getURL(&#8220;callback://GetStereoStatus&#8221;, &#8220;variableName&#8221;);<br/>
this tells the middleware what variable name to use when it passed the data back to flash. you have to wait one frame in flash before you can reference the data.<br/>
Why should flash be on Playstation 2?<br/>
Currently not avaliable. playstation 2 is very popular platform.<br/>
three versions of flash player for ps2</p>

<ul>
<li>generation one, used on starfighter. only supported flash 4. built by secret level. software only, very slow. doesn&#8217;t support loadmovie, so memory issues cause problems.

<ul>
<li>strobe : (gen 2) &#8211; used by lucasarts for some other games (they have in house flash team). supports flash 5, working on MX version. hardware enabled. also ported to xBox and Directx8. supports loadmovie command.

<ul>
<li>internet version for ps2 : developed by macromedia and sony. deomonstrated at E3 in may 2001. may be related to to linux os and network adaptor kit released by sony. did not play in browser.</UL></li>
</ul>


<p>showing pictures on ps2 linux kit. pretty cool. comes with harddrive and ethernet port.<br/>
website:<br/>
Fred wrote a chapter on Flash for the PS2 in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735711771/">Flash Enabled : Flash Design and Development for Devices</a>.<br/>
<a href="http://www.orangedesign.com">orangedesign.com</a><br/>
<a href="http://www.secretlevel.com">secretlevel.com</a><br/>
<a href="http://www.lucasarts.com">lucasarts.com</a><br/>
future they want to be able to use the flash player within the games, overlaying the action and even showing video.<br/>
testing. worked on pc. they had firewire connection into test unit that they used to upload the entire game into the ps2, and then test it on the console.<br/>
orange did not do the sound.<br/>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was my session on Flash Remoting (sorry,&nbsp;i couldn&#8217;t blog it in real time). It was an advanced session, and i spent a lot of time talking about architeting Flash Remoting Applications.<br/>
I discussed Object Oriented Client / Server interfaces, which is a design patter where you encapsulte all of your client / server code within ActionScript objects. This makes the code more reusable, but also creates a simplified ActionScript API for the service. It also abstracts all of the complexity of the code, and client / server communications away from the developer / user.<br/>
I show some simple ActionScript examples that demonstrated this (i will upload them later). I then went through and showed some Applications that used some Client / Server Service Libraries (Email and Stock). I showed an stock charting app, and well as a Flash Email client i created (which has a sneak peak of some new components).<br/>
I then showed a simple flash application that called the google web service via Flash Remoting, and allowed you to search google from Flash.<br/>
Finally, i pulled up the stock application again, change one line of code (pointing to the server), and switched the back end code from ColdFusion to an .NET DLL written in c#. The Flash Remoting code was the same conencting to both. The server side code has no flash specific code in it, and I pulled up a windows app that used the DLL to deomstrate this.<br/>
I will try to post some more details and files later.<br/>
end of session</p>

Christian started by covering some of his slides that he was not able to get to yesterday. He also showed some of his code for the Flash mp3 player that hooks up to his iPod, and finally he show a simple app that uses Flash Remoting to create a Flash console for OSX (allows him to run a pseudo console from a Flash app).<br/>
I just realized thay my session is at 10:15 and not 11:00, so I am going to have to cut these notes short.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The keynote was awesome. To quote Lynda Weinman, &#8220;This was the best keynote ever&#8221;.</p>

<p>It started off with Kevin Lynch talking about the Macromedia MX launch, the most significant and aggressive launch in the history of Macromedia.</p>

<p>Kevin then spent some time discussing usability in Flash, pointing out some of the books that have been written on the topic (skip intro, flash 99% good), and some of the people who have been pushing usability in Flash, such as Chris MacGregor of <a href="http://www.flazoom.com">Flazoom.com</a>, and more recently Jacob Nielsen. Kevin then talked about the importance of engaging in a discussion about Flash usability, especially with those who are critical, in order to learn from some of their arguments.</p>

<p>Kevin then discussed Macromedia Flash and Advertising, and pointed the incredible growth of the use of Flash in online advertising, and its successes. In august of last year, there were 100 million Flash advertising impressions a week. Today there are 1 billion impressions a week.</p>

<p>We then showed a Mike&#8217;s hard lemonade Flash movie, that was created from a television commercial.</p>

<p>Kevin then invited me up on the stage, and we created a simple application using Flash MX, ColdFusion MX and Flash Remoting. Of course, I had some typos in my code, but after those were fixed, we created an app that used a new DataGrid component that we have been working on to display the results of a data base query that shows all of the FlashForward Session information.</p>

<p>Kevin then talked about some of the pioneering work done in computers in the 50&#8242;s and 60&#8242;s, and introduced a clip of a presentation by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=Doug+Engelbart&amp;btnG=Google+Search">Doug Engelbart</a>, and his <a href="http://sloan.stanford.edu/mousesite/1968Demo.html">famous 1968 video</a> of distributed collaboration and real-time video in a graphical computer.</p>

<p>It is really hard to describe the excitement and electricity in the audience while viewing the clips. You will have to use the link above to view them. We showed the introduction to the presentation, and doug typing on the screen, and then a clip where he was collaborating with someone remotely (using text and video!).</p>

<p>Kevin then opened up a Flash Communication Server application, which linked him and Flash Forward to Palo Alto, California and Doug Engelbart. When he came through on the video, the audience gave the loudest and longest applause of the morning.</p>

<p>Doug talked about how after he got engaged, he realized he didn&#8217;t have any long term goals. He decided that he should dedicate himself to making a positive difference to humankind, and that one way to do that would be to figure out a way to make communication and collaboration easier. Doug, who has actually used director in the past, said that he would like to see applications that make it simple to connect users via video, and then archive and search that video (as easy as searching and indexing text on the web).</p>

<p>After another long round of applause, Kevin asked Chris Hock from the Flash Communication Server team to come onstage, and build a Flash based communication application. Using the Flash Communication Server components (kevin noted they would be available soon), he built an application that had video windows, login element, a list of everyone connected, and a status light. He wrote no ActionScript at all. He published, and then some Macromedia people in the audience also connected via their webcams.</p>

<p>After that, the audience was invited to go to the computers, and ask questions via the app that was just built.</p>

<p>I spoke with a lot of people after the keynote, and everyone was really excited about the presentation and the communication server. This was definitely the best keynote that i have ever seen us present.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Christian Cantrell : <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#x6f;&#58;&#x71;&#x61;&#110;&#116;&#x72;&#x65;&#108;&#108;&#x40;&#121;&#97;&#104;&#111;&#x6f;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;">&#x71;&#x61;&#x6e;&#116;&#114;&#x65;&#x6c;&#x6c;&#64;&#121;&#97;&#x68;&#111;&#x6f;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>&nbsp;: note all code examples, and slides (very nice) will be included online.<br/>
Flash Remoting is a server-side technology which allows for the intergration of Flash applications with existing application server logic.<br/>
Exposes remote services through a simple ActionScript API.<br/>
Uses AMF (Action Messaging Format) to communicate with player / server. Very efficient binary format made specifically for ActionScript.<br/>
Getting started : need</p>

<ul>
<li>Flash MX

<ul>
<li>Flash Remoting Components (avaliable from macromedia.com)

<ul>
<li>A server that has the Flash Remoting Adaptor installed.</UL></li>
</ul>


<p>Flash Remoting ActionScript objects:</p>

<ul>
<li>NetServices.as : core ActionScript logic of Flash Remoting. Provides functionality to connect to Flash Remoting adaptor on server.

<ul>
<li>RecordSet : Object representing a set of data records, usually returned from a database.

<ul>
<li>DataGlue : Utility object for mapping columns in a RecordSet to proerties of UI components.

<ul>
<li>NetDebug : Utlity object for helping to debug&nbsp;client/server interactions (using NetConnectoin Debugger Panel).</UL></li>
</ul>


<p>Creating packages for Flash Remoting Services<br/>
A package is implimented as a logical directory structure where the files that contain Flash Remoting services are kept. (start from the document root).<br/>
Uses domain name in reverse (com/domainname) to prevent namespace collisions (i.e. two services with the same name). by placing them in a directory structure like this, you dont have to worry about other peoples files overwriting yours (just like java packages).<br/>
In actionscript, you use dots, instead of slashes to refer to directory structure (com.domainname) (<em>note, i think you can do it either way-mc</em>).<br/>
Creating Flash Remoting Services with ColdFusion pages (.cfm)<br/>
ColdFusion pahes that are called through Flash Remoting have access to the &#8220;flash&#8221; variable scope, which contains all of the data sent from Flash.<br/>
The directory containing the page is considered the service, and the page name is treated like the function name.<br/>
simple flash remoting service in CFML
<PRE>&lt;!&#8212;package com.macromedia.flashforward&#8212;&gt;</PRE></p>

<p><PRE>&lt;cfset str = #flash.params[1]# /&gt;</PRE></p>

<p><PRE>&lt;cfset flash.result = Reverse(#str#) /&gt;</PRE></p>

<p>This is a ColdFusion service that takes a string, and returns it in reverse. The params array is an array that contains all of the aruguments and data passed in from the Flash applicaiton (via Flash Remoting).<br/>
ActionScript:<br/>
NetServices.setGatewayURL(url); this tells Flash where the server is located.<br/>
var con = NetServices.createGatewayConnection(); //this returns a reference to the server.<br/>
var pageService = con.getService(&#8220;com.macromedia.flashforward&#8221;, this); //this gets a reference to the remote service. the second parameter, specifies where the functions that will handle the data sent back from the server will be (in this case on the same timeline as the ActionScript code).<br/>
(note : christian is running his presentation from a powerbook with OSX. He is running ColdFusion MX on OSX.).<br/>
Creating services for Flash using ColdFusion Components<br/>
A single ColdFusion Component can provide multiple services (implimented as functions). These can also be called directly from ColdFusion pages, or as web services.<br/>
note : code will be avaliable online.<br/>
ActionScript<br/>
Instead of specifying callback functions that receive the data from the server, on the main timeline, you should attach them to an object, so you keep the functions within their own scope / namespace.
<PRE>var result = new Object();</PRE></p>

<p><PRE>result.onResult = function(data){//stuff here};</PRE></p>

<p>christian named his buttons the same as his remote service, that way he can use the button labels to decide which function to call:
<PRE>function clickHandler(button){urlService<a href="input.text">button.getLabel()</a>;};</PRE></p>

<p>performing a databse query using a ColdFusion Component (CFCs)<br/>
The entire ColdFusion Query object can be returned directly to Flash. it will be converted to an ActionScript RecordSet object.<br/>
You can set a pagesize which determines the number of rows the server wil lreturn to the client until the client asks for more (i.e. only initially send first 10 rows of 1000). Server will then send the rest of the rows on demand (without going back to the database, only to Flash Remoting Adaptor).<br/>
Just use a regular CFQUERY tag to get a Query object. You can then return it directly to Flash using CFRETURN.<br/>
ActionScript<br/>
function that receives data from server:
<PRE>function onResult(result)</PRE></p>

<p><PRE>{</PRE></p>

<p><PRE>//dataConsumer, dataProvider, labelString, dataString</PRE></p>

<p><PRE>DataGlue.bindFormatStrings(name, result, &#8220;#LastName#, #FirstName#&#8221;,&#8221; #EmployeeID#&#8221;)</PRE></p>

<p><PRE>}</PRE></p>

<p>note, my battery is running low.<br/>
ServerSide ActionScript<br/>
SSAS allows Flash Developers and designers access to server-side programming with almost no learning code.<br/>
simple SSAS service:
<PRE>function sayHello()</PRE></p>

<p><PRE>{</PRE></p>

<p><PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return &#8220;Hello World&#8221;;</PRE></p>

<p><PRE>}</PRE></p>

<p>called the same way from Flash as you would call ColdFusion services.<br/>
my battery died. Christian showed some server side actionscript examples, and (connecting to DB and loading files).<br/>
he then showed an Flash App that used Flash Remoting to play mp3s off of his iPod. pretty sweet.<br/>
end of session.</p></p></li>
