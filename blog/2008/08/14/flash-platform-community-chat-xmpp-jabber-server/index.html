			<h2>Flash Platform Community Chat XMPP / Jabber Server</h2>
<p class="meta">Thursday, August 14, 2008</p>

<div class="post">
<p>If you have been in the Flash community for a while, then you may remember a chat app that I worked on for Macromedia Central, named &#8220;Central Dev Chat&#8221;. This was a decent chat client, but the thing I liked about it the most, was that it provided an easy way for the community to hang out and chat about the Flash community and development.</p>

<p>Since then, I have tried a couple of solutions to bring a persistent chat back (including IRC) but haven&#8217;t found anything that is easy enough to use and administer. I spent the past week thinking about building a new chat system using AIR and Python, and then remembered that this problem has already been solved with with XMPP / Jabber.</p>

<p>So, I have setup an XMPP / Jabber server on my server and am going to experiment with using it as a community server, especially to host a chat room to talk about the Flash Platform.<br>
&lt;!--more--&gt;</p>

<p>Right now you need to access the room via an IM client with XMPP / Jabber support (I use <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a>), although if there is interest, then I may build an AIR app to connect to the chat (which would make it super easy for anyone to join).</p>

<p>So, here is the server info:</p>

<p><strong>Server</strong> : mikechambers.com<br>
<strong>Port</strong> : 5222</p>

<p>The server allows registration of new account via your IM client.</p>

<p>Here is the info for the chat room:</p>

<p><strong>Room name</strong>: flashplatform_chat<br>
<strong>Server</strong> : conference.mikechambers.com</p>

<p>Note : You may get a warning that the certificate cannot be verified. Just ignore it (I am looking into how to fix it).</p>

<p>If your IM client supports it, then you can just click the link below:</p>

<p><a href="xmpp:flashplatform_chat@conference.mikechambers.com?join">xmpp:flashplatform_chat@conference.mikechambers.com?join</a></p>

<p>You can find a list of IM client which support XMPP / Jabber <a href="http://www.jabber.org/clients">here</a>.</p>

<p>This is an experiment, so especially at first, the server may go up and down, and accounts may get reset. However, if it proves useful, then I would like to keep it as a resource for the community (including adding additional chat rooms).</p>

<p>I am also hoping to weekly scheduled chats with members of AIR, Flash Player and Flex teams.</p>

<h2>Connecting</h2>

<p>Below is information on how to connect to the chat with different IM clients.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a></h3>

<p>If you have an existing Jabber / XMPP account, such as a GTalk account, then you can connect without having to register with my server.</p>

<p>File &gt; Join Group Chat</p>

<p>Select the GTalk server.</p>

<p>Enter these settings:</p>

<p>Chat Room Name: flashplatform_chat<br>
Server : conference.mikechambers.com<br>
Handle : You name / handle<br>
Password : leave blank</p>

<p>Click Join</p>

<p>If you want to create an account on my server then:</p>

<p>File &gt; Add Account &gt; Jabber &gt; Register New Account</p>

<p>When the dialog opens asking for the server, enter <em>mikechambers.com</em></p>

<p>This will enter a dialog where you can add your account info.</p>

<p>Once you have the account, then you need to connect to the room:</p>

<p>File &gt; Join Group Chat</p>

<p>Select mikechambers.com server.</p>

<p>Enter these settings:</p>

<p>Chat Room Name: flashplatform<em>chat<br>
Server : conference.mikechambers.com<br>
Handle : YOUR\</em>SERVER_USERNAME<br>
Password : YOUR_SERVER_PASSWORD</p>

<p>Cliff Rowley has <a href="http://www.mikechambers.com/blog/2008/08/14/flash-platform-community-chat-xmpp-jabber-server/#comment-13278">posted instructions for iChat in this comment</a>.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>Keep things civil and act as if you were actually talking to everyone else in person. If anyone is being disruptive or abusive, then I reserve the right to temporarily or permanently ban then from the server.</p>

<p>If you have info on how to connect to the chat with a particular IM client, please post it in the comments to help others figure it out. If you run into any issues, or have problems, please post in the comments, and I will try and help out.</p>
