I have been getting a lot of questions today about which [DRKs][1] are included with [DevNet Pro Subscriptions][2]. So here is the answer.

When you subscribe to DevNet Pro, you get:

*   DRK Special Edition (Contains a selection of the extensions and components from Volumes 1 and 2)
*   The current DRK (which is currently 3)
*   The next 3 DRKs

So basically, DevNet Pro includes DRK 1 and 2, which were part of Studio MX plus, plus a subscription to DevNet Essentials. Hope that helps clarify the question.
