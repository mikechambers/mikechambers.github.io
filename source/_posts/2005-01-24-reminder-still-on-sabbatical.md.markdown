Just a quick reminder, but I am currently on a 6 week sabbatical, which among other things means that I am not checking emails or voice mails.

So, what have I been doing thus far? Playing with my daughter a lot, reading, playing video games ([World of Warcraft][1] and [Mercenaries on Xbox][2]), and teaching myself some electrical engineering. I have been having a blast.

I will be back around February 14th (at which time I am off to [MXDU][3]).
