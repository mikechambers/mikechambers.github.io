Just noticed a couple of articles examining Macromedia Flash and Rich Internet Applications. The first, at oreillynet.com:  
  
*   [A Pet Market with Flash][1]

  
discusses the [Pet Market Blueprint Application][2], and the advantages that using Flash provides. The second article:  
  
*   [Flash Strikes Back: Creating Powerful Web Applications][3]

  
also discusses using Flash to create rich internet applications, focusing on the enhanced possibility and usability that Flash can offer.
