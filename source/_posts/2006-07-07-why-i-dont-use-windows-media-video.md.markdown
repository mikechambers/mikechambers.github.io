Earlier this week, Robert Scoble wrote up why he thinks that the [use of Flash is a bad idea][1]. I thought I would provide my thoughts on that post.

Why don&#8217;t I use Windows Media Video for my Web sites? [Here&#8217;s a good reason][2].

I have a brand new OS X Mac Book Pro machine. Loaded Safari on it. And visited [Scoble&#8217;s site to watch an interview with him][3].

[This is what it looked like][2]. Now, if a &#8220;normal&#8221;¬ù person (non geek) hit this site, what would they do? I&#8217;ll tell you what they&#8217;ll do. They&#8217;ll hit back and get out of there. Note the title tag. Failed to open page? I click that little green back button and leave before I get hurt. Thank you very much. Have a nice day.

Lesson: always recognize poor implementations of technology, before you make sweeping generalizations about a technology based on that implementation.

(This applies to pretty much any technology).

(btw, I agree with [Scoble][1] that that particular use and implementation was poor. I do not agree with his assumption that that thus means all use of Flash is bad).
