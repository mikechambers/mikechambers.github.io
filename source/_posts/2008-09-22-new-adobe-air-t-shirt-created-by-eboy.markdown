Here is a sneak peak of the new AIR t-shirts (with a shout out to Flex and Flash). These were created by [eboy][1], who also created the[ AIR 1.0 launch t-shirts][2].

Right now, the only way to get these is to attend one of the developer events on [Ryan&#8217;s][4] and [my][5] tour through Asia. We will be printing more after that though and its a good bet that we will have some at [Max][6].
