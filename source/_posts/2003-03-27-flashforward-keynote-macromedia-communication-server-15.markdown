During the keynote this morning, Kevin Lynch announced that a new version of the Macromedia Flash Communication Server is available. Version 1.5 adds a number of new features and bug fixes including:

*   HTTP Tunneling (to get around firewall issues)
*   Support for Linux
*   MP3 Support

We have also released a free developers edition of the server which does not timeout.

Kevin then showed part of a 15 minute video which was streaming live from the Flash Communication Server and running full screen.
