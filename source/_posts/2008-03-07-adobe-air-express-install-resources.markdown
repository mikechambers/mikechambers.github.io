I am currently working on updating the &#8220;[Adobe AIR for JavaScript Developers Pocketguide][1]&#8221; (O&#8217;Reilly), and was looking for resources on deploying AIR applications via express install. If you are not familiar with it, express install allows you to deploy your application via a badge on your website. Not only will it install your application, but it will also install Adobe AIR if it is not on its user&#8217;s system.

Anyways, here are a couple of really good resources if you want to read and learn more about express install:

[Deploying Adobe AIR applications seamlessly with badge install][2]

[Installing and running AIR applications from a web page][3]
