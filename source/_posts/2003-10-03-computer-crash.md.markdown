Well, my HD died this morning and I haven&#8217;t been able to recover anything yet. I am on a longer power book (thanks dc!) and using webmail, so it might take me a while to respond to any emails.

I did loose a lot of emails, so if you have emailed me something important the last couple of days and have not heard back from me, please re-send it.
