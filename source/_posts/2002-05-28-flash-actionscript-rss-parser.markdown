[Sam Wan][1] has created an ActionScript class that parses RSS XML feeds and makes them available as an ActionScript data object. This is one of the first steps for the Flash interface to [Moveable type][2] that he is putting together (of course, since it is RSS based, it should also work with [Radio][3]).  
This is similar to the [FResourceFeed][4] Class that I created to parse the [Macromedia XML Resource feed][5], except that Sam&#8217;s will work with a LOT more data feeds.
