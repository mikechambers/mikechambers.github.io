A couple of weeks ago I spent a couple of days down at the Lynda.com offices to put together [a complete video overview / introduction to Apollo][1].

Well, the videos have just been posted and you can check them out for free from [Lynda.com][1].

These cover everything you need to know to get started with Apollo development.
