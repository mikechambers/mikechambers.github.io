I have been cleaning out a bunch of stuff in my office, and came across a bunch of old Macromedia stuff. Before I parted with it, I decided to take pictures of everything and upload them to flickr.

You can view the entire photoset [here][1]. 

I have not added titles, but feel free to add descriptions in the comments. I tagged everything as mm_stuff. Ill upload more images as I come across stuff.
