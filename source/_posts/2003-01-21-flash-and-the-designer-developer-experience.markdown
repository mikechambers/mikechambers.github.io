[Mike Williams][1] is looking for some more input from Flash developers. Today he is asking about experience and how tools can help or hinder collaboration between designers and developers.

*How do you as Internet designers and developers feel tools can address the issue of working better together? What frameworks appeal to you and how do you think they translate to Flash design and development?*

You can view the entire thread, and post your comments [here][1].
