We are trying out something new today. Basically, we have a limited number of 10% off coupon codes for the Macromedia store. This is on a first come, first serve basis, and is an opportunity&nbsp;for us to&nbsp;give&nbsp;something back to to the core of our community.  
So, todays code is : SP23CMMRBK  
This code is good for the [Book / Training section][1], which among other things, includes the [Macromedia MX Developer Resource Kit (DRK)][2].  
More codes to follow in the coming days. Thanks to [Matt Brown][3], the Dreamweaver MX community manager, who organized this. Note, please do not distribute the code. We would like people to access it through our weblogs, so we can see how useful it is.  
Update : Apparently some people are having trouble with the code. We are looking into it, and apologize for the hassle. Has anyone successfully used the code yet? If so, could you post in the comments?
