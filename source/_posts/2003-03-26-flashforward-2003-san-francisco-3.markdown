Well, today is the first day of [FlashForward][1]. I haven&#8217;t had a chance to get out to the conference yet (I am busy working on some surprises), but I have talked to a few people who are there, and I hear that it is packed, and that people are really excited.

I will be heading out there in a couple of hours, so if you see me, make sure to say hi. In the meantime, if you are attending, make sure to [fill out your profile][2]. This is a pretty cool application built in Flash which makes it really easy to find other people with similar skills and interest.

Also, I will be blogging the conference as much as I can. You can view the [FlashForward section][3] for all of the posts.
