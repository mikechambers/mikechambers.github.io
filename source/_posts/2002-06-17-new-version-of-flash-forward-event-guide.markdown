Eric Dolecki has released an updated version of his super sweet [FlashForward 2002 event guide][1].  
There are a ton of features in this including all of the conference info, local maps and information, and the ability to rate sessions.  
Eric also gives thanks to a lot of Flash developers who helped him out. Another great example of the Flash community putting their heads together and creating some kick ass applications.
