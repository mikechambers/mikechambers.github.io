The title pretty much sums it up. Is anyone using ActionScript 2 as the root content of an AIR application? or know or any AIR apps built with ActionScript 2 at the root content?

Note that Im not talking about AIR applications that are built in ActionScript 3 that contain AS2, but rather AIR applications that has its main root content as AS2 content.

Also, if you are using AS2 content in an AS3 or HTML based AIR application, what are you using it for.
