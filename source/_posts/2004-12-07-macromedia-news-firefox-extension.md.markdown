I have put together a [simple extension][1] for [FireFox][2] which makes it easy to keep up with the latest Macromedia news, information and weblog posts. It places a small icon on the FireFox task bar that, when clicked displays all of the latest information. The extension will periodically check for new data, and blink when it finds new information.

Here are a couple of screenshots:
