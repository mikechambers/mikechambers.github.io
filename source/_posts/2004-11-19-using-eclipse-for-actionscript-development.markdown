In my never ending quest for a decent code editor on OS X, I have recently installed [Eclipse][1] with the [ActionScript 2 plugin][2]. I haven&#8217;t used it enough yet to have an opinion on it, but I wanted to get some input from other developers.

Have you used Eclipse for ActionScript, Flash or Flex development? If so, what do you think? Are you still using it? Did you like it? What don&#8217;t you like? What is missing?
