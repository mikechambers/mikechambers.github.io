If you follow me on [twitter][1], then you may have noticed that I have been working on a white-paper laying out the roadmap and strategy for the Flash runtimes (Flash Player and Adobe AIR). The white-paper is going through internal review now, and should be available in the next 7 to 10 days. 

As part of the release of the white-paper, I, along with [Lee Brimelow][2], and [Thibault Imbert][3] will be spending two weeks in Europe meeting with the Flash community and laying out Adobe&#8217;s vision and strategy for the Flash runtimes. This will be a good opportunity to speak directly with Adobe, ask questions, and general discuss recent changes around the Flash Player.

Here are the cities we will be visiting. Click through the links to find more information and to register for the events.

*   [February 22 : Paris][4]
*   [February 23 : London][5]
*   [February 26 : FITC Amsterdam][6]
*   [February 29 : Hamburg][7]
*   [March 02 : Lisbon][8]

In addition to discussing the Flash roadmap, we will be showing off the latest Flash and Adobe AIR content, give some sneak peaks on upcoming releases, and setting aside plenty of time for open discussions and Q&A.

The Flex team will be in Europe at the same time, discussing the future of Adobe Flex under the Apache organization. You can find information on the Flex tour [here][9].

We plan similar tours over the next couple of months for North and South America, and Asia. Ill post more info here once we have more details.
