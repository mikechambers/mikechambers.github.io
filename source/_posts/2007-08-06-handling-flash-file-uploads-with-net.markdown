Denis Sosnovtsev has posted a really useful blog post over on the [atellis labs site][1]. The post shows [how to upload files from Flash to a .NET backend][2]. The example includes both ActionScript and .NET / C# code snippets.

You can view the entire post [here][2].

You can also view [Mark Piller&#8217;s session from the on AIR Bus tour on integrating .NET with Adobe AIR applications][3].

Know any other good ActionScript / .NET resources and tutorials? Post them in the comments.
