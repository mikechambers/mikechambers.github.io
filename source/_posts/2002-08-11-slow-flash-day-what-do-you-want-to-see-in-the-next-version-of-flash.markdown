Things have been a little slow lately, thus the lack of posts. Why don&#8217;t we have a question of the day.  
**What features would you like to see in the next version of Flash? Or what themes would you like to see emphasized?**  
I am in San Francisco all week, so I will gather all of the comments into a doc and pass them on to the appropriate people.  
Of course, you can always submit your feature requests [here][1].
