Just a heads up but I am going to be attending the following conferences in the next couple of weeks:

[FITC][1] Toronto April 21 &#8211; 23 (with xbox in tow ;)  
[Ajax experience][2] San Francisco May 10 &#8211; 12th

Im helping out with the keynote and doing a platform panel at FITC in Toronto, and will just be catching sessions at the Ajax experience. If you are going to be at either conference make sure to ping me before hand or find me at the conference.
