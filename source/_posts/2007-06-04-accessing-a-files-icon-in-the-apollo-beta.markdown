Kevin Hoyt gives a sneak peak of one of the new features in the upcoming beta that allows you to [access an file&#8217;s system icon bitmap data][1] from within an Apollo application.

Kevin&#8217;s example is in HTML and JavaScript, but the same technique applies to ActionScript.

You can see the entire post, [complete with code and screencast over at Kevin&#8217;s weblog][1].
