Christian Cantrell.  
Christian started by covering some of his slides that he was not able to get to yesterday. He also showed some of his code for the Flash mp3 player that hooks up to his iPod, and finally he show a simple app that uses Flash Remoting to create a Flash console for OSX (allows him to run a pseudo console from a Flash app).  
I just realized thay my session is at 10:15 and not 11:00, so I am going to have to cut these notes short.
