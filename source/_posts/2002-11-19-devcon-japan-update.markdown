Sorry for the lack of posts and updates the past couple of days. I had planned to blog the first day of DevCon Japan, but I ended up getting a pretty bad case of food poisoning and was stuck in bed for the past two days...  
Anyways, I am feeling better and have a couple of sessions today. I will try to get some reports up from the conference.
