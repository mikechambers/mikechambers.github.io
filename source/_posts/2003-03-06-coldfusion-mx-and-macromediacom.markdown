Most of the discussion concerning the [Macromedia.com website beta][1] has focused around its use of Flash. However, I think that one of the most important / coolest things about the website is the fact that it has been completely re-written using [ColdFusion MX][2].

Christian Cantrell [notes][3] this, and I have to agree with him when he says:

*If there was any question whether CFMX was ready for the enterprise market, I think we now have an answer.*

Btw, there are still a few pages which have not been transitioned over to ColdFusion MX yet, including the [feedback form][4].
