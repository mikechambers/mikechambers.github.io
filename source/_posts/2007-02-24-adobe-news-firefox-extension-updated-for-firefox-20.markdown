I just updated the [Adobe news Firefox extension][1] so that it will now work with Firefox 2.0.

The extension has not yet been re-branded from Macromedia to Adobe, but it still aggregates all of the weblog posts from Adobe.

You can find more information, as well as download the latest version from [here][1].
