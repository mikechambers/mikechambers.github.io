I am going to be updating the links and resources on the left side of my weblog. If you know of a Flash weblog which is not linked, or is linked incorrectly, then post the URL in the comments. I try to only list sites which are updated frequently or have useful info, so please keep that in mind.

Also, I have been considering adding a section for international weblogs about Flash, so if you know of any, post them in the comments along with the language that are in.
