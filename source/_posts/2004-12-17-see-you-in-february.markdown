Macromedia has a really great sabbatical program. For every four years you work here, you get a 6 week, paid sabbatical. Well, I have been at Macromedia for about 4 1/ 2 years now which means I am finally eligible for my sabbatical.

So, today is my last day in the office until February 14, 2005 (in additional to the sabbatical I am taking a week off next week, and we get a week off for Christmas). What does this mean? Well, my weblog probably wont be updated much if any, and I probably wont be checking my Macromedia email that often (if any). I will still be on IM, so if you want to chat, feel free to ping me.

So what am I going to be doing over my sabbatical? Well, we are trying to buy a house, so I can&#8217;t take any big trips, but I will be hanging out with my daughter, playing video games (mostly [Halo 2][1]), reading, programing, exercising (finally), and just generally relaxing. 

Anyways, it has been a great first four years, and I want to thank everyone in the Flash community for all of the dedication and passion they have put into the community. You have made Flash a success, and made my job a lot of fun. Try to rest up over the holidays, because 2005 is shaping up to be one of the most exciting in Macromedia and Flash&#8217;s history. See you in February.
