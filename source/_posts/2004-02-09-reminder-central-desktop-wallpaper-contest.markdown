Just a quick reminder that I am hold a contest for the best Central themed desktop wallpaper. There are already a bunch of [entries][1], but the deadline is not until Friday, so there is still plenty of time to make a submission. (Plus, you could win an Xbox!).

You can find more information [here][1].
