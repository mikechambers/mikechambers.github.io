As Emmy [blogged][1] last week, we have just posted a [beta version of Flash Player 8.5 targeted at testing compatibility with existing sites][2]. As always, backwards compatibility is one of our primary goals with the Flash Player, and Player 8.5 is no different.

So, take some time to download the player, check your content, and make sure everything is working correctly. If you find issues with existing content, [let us know][3] so we can fix them.

Note, if you are already using the [Flash Player 8.5 beta from labs][4], then you can continue to use that build and report any compatibility issues.

You can download this bits, as well as find information on where to report issues from [here][2].
