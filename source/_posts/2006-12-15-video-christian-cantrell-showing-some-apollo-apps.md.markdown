I have just uploaded a 10 minute video interview / discussion with Christian Cantrell of the Apollo team. Christian talks about his role on the Apollo team, and shows some Flex / HTML applications that he has been working on.

[View on Google Video][1]

[Download High Resolution mp4 of the video][2] (100 megs). 

You can find more information on Apollo [here][3].

FYI, this is our first video, so we are still working out some of the kinks.
