About a year ago, [Lee Brimelow][1] and I released a simple application named [flump][2] that would download all of the images from a flickr account. We made this so we could download all of the webcam images from the bus tour, and put together a time lapsed video (you can view some of that video [here][3]).

The original version worked on the beta 1 release of Adobe AIR, and did not work on the release version. I have just uploaded a new version which works on AIR 1.1 and adds a couple of new features and fixes some bugs.
