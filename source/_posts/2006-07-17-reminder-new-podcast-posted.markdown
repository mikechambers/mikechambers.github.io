Just a quick reminder, but I posted a [new Podcast][1] on Friday afternoon. This podcast includes a discussion around Apollo as a Runtime with some members of the Apollo engineering team.

You can find more info as well as grab the podcast from [here][1].

Btw, I don&#8217;t normally re-link articles like this, but wanted to since the podcast was posted late on Friday.
