Just a quick fyi, but I just fixed the [issue][1] with the Macromedia News Firefox Extension that was keeping it from working in Firefox 1.5.

As I suspected, it was the same problem that I [posted about earlier][2].

Anyways, I will post an updated version later tonight or first thing in the morning.
