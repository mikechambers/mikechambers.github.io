I am heading to Europe in a little over a week for a couple of conferences. First up is [FITC Amsterdam][1] (sold out) where I will be helping [Serge][2] and [Lee][3] out with the keynote, and doing a session on [Advanced Desktop Development with Adobe AIR.][4] After Amsterdam, Serge, Lee and I will be heading over to London for the [FlashCamp London][1], where I will be doing a session on [migrating from ActionScript 2 to ActionScript 3, targeting at non-developers][5].

Ill be in Amsterdam a couple of days before the event, so if anyone wants to grab a beer, or some Frietjes and lekkerbek, just ping me.
