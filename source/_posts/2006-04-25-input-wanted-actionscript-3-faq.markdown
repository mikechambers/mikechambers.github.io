I am about to go through and update the [ActionScript 3 FAQ][1] on labs to bring it in line with recent changes in the ActionScript 3 and Flex 2 betas. Before I do though, what other questions / answers would you like added to the FAQ?

You can view the current FAQ [here][1].

If you have any suggestions, or find something in the FAQ that is out of date, or needs more info, just post it here.
