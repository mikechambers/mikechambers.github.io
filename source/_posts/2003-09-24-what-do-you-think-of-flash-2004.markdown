[Flash 2004 / Flash 2004 Pro][1] have been available for a couple of weeks now. I have seen the full range of responses from raves to rage. So, now that you have had a couple of weeks to play with it, what do you think?

What do you love? What do you hate? What problems have you run into? What features have you found that you could not live without now? What is your general impression?

Post you comments in the comments section. If you post about a problem that you have run into, please include your OS and system specs.

Don&#8217;t hold anything back.
