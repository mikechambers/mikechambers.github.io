Well, after a 14 hour flight, I have finally made it to Sydney. I am currently hanging out at the hotel with [Sean Corfield][1], waiting to be able to check into my room (it is 9am here, can&#8217;t check in until at least 12).

I am really excited about the [mxdu conference][2] this week. I have always been impressed by the strength of the Australian developer community, and it will be cool to finally get to meet a lot of them in person. I am staying at the Star City hotel and hope to get to hang out some.

One side note, the hotel doesn&#8217;t have internet access, and I forgot to set up my dial up account before I left, so my internet and email access will probably be sporadic until at least Tuesday (Monday in US).
