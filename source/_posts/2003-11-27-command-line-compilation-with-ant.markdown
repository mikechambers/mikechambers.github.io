[Ethan Malasky][1], an engineer on the [Central][2] team, has created a weblog. His first post includes a custom ANT task that he and [Mike Williams][3] built to compile their Flash projects from the command line.

This ant task is specific to Central and allows you to install and publish applications into Central. However, you could of corse modify it for any Flash build process.

You can view the post and download the code from [here][1].
