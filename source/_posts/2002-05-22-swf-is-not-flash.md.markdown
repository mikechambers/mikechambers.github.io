Interesting [article][1] on the O&#8217;Reilly Devcenter discussing Flash and SVG. The author is trying to overcome some of the misperceptions of Flash in the development world.  
If you read through some of the [comments][2], you will see some of these misperceptions come up, especially the &#8220;Flash is just an animation tool and can&#8217;t be used for applications&#8221; argument. This may&nbsp;have been true with Flash 3, and maybe Flash 4, but with Flash MX I can&nbsp;create a very complex, functional UI in about 5 minutes, and focus my development efforts on making my application work.  
Finally, while SVG mobile may hold great promise for the future, the Flash player is in the mobile space today with players for numerous mobile devices, including [Pocket PCs][3] and Nokia Communicators.
