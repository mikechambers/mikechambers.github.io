If you have already visited my blog since last night, then you have probably already noticed, but I have given my weblog a (much needed) face-lift.

I put in a completely new design, and updated some of the code for the sidebar. The design is based on a WordPress template put together by [Marcos Sader][1], which I converter to Moveable Type and tweaked to my liking.

I also added some new code / sections on the sidebar nav. You can now view my last 10 delicious posts, as well as all of my podcasts (thus far, only one). Both of the sidebars are automatically updated using a combination of PHP, and MoveableType Plugins.

The picture at the top is from Amsterdam&#8217;s Centraal Station (from last November when I was at [Spark Europe][2]).

If you have any questions or suggestions, or run into any bugs, just post them in the comments.
