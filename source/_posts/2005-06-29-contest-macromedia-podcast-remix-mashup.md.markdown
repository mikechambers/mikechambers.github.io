As I posted [yesterday][1], [Christian Cantrell][2] and I just released the first [Macromedia Developer Relations podcast][3]. We weren&#8217;t sure how well it would come out or how well it would be received, and have been blown away by the positive response thus far (we are already working on the next one).

Anyways, as we mentioned in the podcast, we released the podcast under the following creative commons license:

[Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License][4]

Of course, it is no fun releasing under a creative commons license unless someone takes advantage of it. So, to help spur that, we are having a contest for the best mashup / creative use of the podcast.  
<!--more-->

  
The top three submissions will win a Flash Timbuk2 Messenger bag.

You can download the podcast from [here][3].

We have also posted the raw uncompressed source of the podcast [here][5]. (WARNING : This file is nearly 250 megs).
