I have just uploaded the source code for the Windows version of my FlashCommand command line compiler for Flash MX 2004. You can download the source from [here][1].

I haven&#8217;t touched this code in a long time, and it is not documented much. However I wanted to get it out to the community in case anyone wanted to add features or fix bugs. 

Robin Debreuil, Owen van Dijk both helped me with some items and contributed some code.

You can download an OS X version of FlashCommand (which includes source) from [here][2].

The only issue that I know of is that the installation code does not currently work. 

Anyways, if you make changes or fix anything then post it in the comments. I am interested to see what (if anything) people do with this.
