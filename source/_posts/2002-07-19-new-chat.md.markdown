Well, I got my [mediatemple][1] hosting account set up, and I have put up a simple chat app on the top of the page. It was built with Flash MX and uses the [Flash Communication Server][2] to handler all of the communications.  
This is just an experiment right now. Post any suggestions, likes / dislikes in the comments.
