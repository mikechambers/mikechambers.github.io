I have posted chapter 2 of the [Adobe AIR for Flex Developers Pocketguide][1] on tostring.org. The chapter is titled [Getting Started with Adobe AIR Development][2] and covers (from the chapter):

*   Installing Adobe AIR 
*   Configuring the Flex SDK and command-line tools 
*   Creating your first AIR application with the Flex SDK and Flex Builder 3 
*   Testing AIR applications 
*   Signing, packaging, and deploying AIR applications 

This is just a draft chapter (.85) and I am looking for any comments, input, questions or suggestions on the chapter. If you have any input, just leave a comment on the [chapter page][2].
