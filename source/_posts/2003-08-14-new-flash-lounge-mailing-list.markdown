Following up on my [earlier post][1], Branden Hall has [created][2] the [Flash-Lounge mailing list][3] to allow people in the Flash community discuss just about anything.

You can find more info on it, as well as how to sign up [here][3].

Thanks also to Michael Trezza who also volunteered to setup a list.
