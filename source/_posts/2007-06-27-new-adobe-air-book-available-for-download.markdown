[Danny Dura][1], [Kevin Hoyt][2] and myself have been working on a new Adobe AIR book, which has just been published. The book, which is published by O&#8217;Reilly, is titled *Adobe Integrated Runtime for JavaScript Developers Pocketguide* and provides an introduction to [Adobe AIR][3], targeted at HTML and JavaScript developers.

Not only can you [buy it from Amazon][5], but [Ajaxian.com has posted the entire book online for download][6].

The book is released under a creative commons license, and we will also be posting it on labs for download.

Btw, we plan to update the [Adobe Flex for Developers Pocketguide][7] for the 1.0 release of Adobe AIR.
