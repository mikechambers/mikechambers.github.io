I have started to see some questions and comments from people who noticed that [Contribute 2.0][1] will include a pilot of [Product Activation][2]. We are well aware that this is a potentially very heated issue, and thus have spent a lot of time, effort and resources making sure that it works well and is unobtrusive. We are also trying to be as forthcoming with information as possible, and thus have posted a ton of information about activation on our site.

As part of this, we are also changing our EULA to allow for users to install the software on more than one computer (for non-concurrent usage). You can find more info on that [here][3].

Here are some links with information about how we are implementing product activation.

*   [Product Activation Center][2]
*   [Activation FAQ][4]
*   [Activation Demo / Tour][5]
*   [Technical Whitepaper][6] (shows the actual XML that is sent during an activation request)
*   [Security and Privacy Audit][7]

So, check out the links above and post any comments, questions or thoughts in the comments section below.
