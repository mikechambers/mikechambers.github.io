Just a quick reminder that the deadline for [Halo 2 application contest][1] is this Friday. Basically, the best application / site built with ColdFusion and / or Flash / Flex that uses data from the halo site wins a bunch of goodies.

There are already a couple of entries, but to make things more interesting, I will send a Flash t-shirt to anyone who submits a decent entry.

More details [here][1].
