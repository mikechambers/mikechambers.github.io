I just uploaded new versions of the [open source ActionScript 3 libraries][1] to labs. The new versions work with the release versions of Flex 2 and Flex Builder 2.

This includes updates to corelib (JSON, etc..), flexunit, and the XMLSyndication (Atom / RSS) libraries.

You can find more information on the libraries, as well as download them from [here][1].
