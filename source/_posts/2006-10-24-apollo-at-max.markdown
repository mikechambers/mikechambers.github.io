Wow! Tons of info on Apollo today (keynote, 3 sessions, birds of a feather, Maxup). The team has been blown away by how excited people have been about Apollo here (they had to turn people away from some of the Apollo sessions because they were so packed).

Anyways, I will have more posts soon going over all of the new information, but in the mean time, make sure to check out the [Apollo Smart category at MXNA][1]. It has tons of posts on Apollo, and notes from today&#8217;s sessions.
