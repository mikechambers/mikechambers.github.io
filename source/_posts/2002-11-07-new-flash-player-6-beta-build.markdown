We have released a new build of the Flash Player 6 Beta player. It is available for Windows, Mac and Linux platforms, and contains quite a few fixes and addition.  
You can find a complete list of fixes in the [release notes][1].  
You can find more info as well as download the player [here][2].  
Make sure that you [report any bugs][3] that you find, and you could win some pretty cool prizes.  
In particular, we need the following areas to be tested:  
  
*   Shared objects  
    *   Text entry (particularly international text)  
        *   Local files and CD-based content  
            *   Movies using bitmaps, and  
                *   ActionScript intensive movies.  
                    *   Windowless Mode  
                        *   Runtime Shared Libraries  
                            *   ActionScript performance  
                                *   Customization of HTTP headers </UL>
