Daniel Dura has just released the [Twitter application that we used at Apollo Camp][1] to help coordinate back chanell conversations (it saved us from a beer disaster!).

Anyways, not only can you download the application, but Danny has also open sourced it, and made the source available. So, now you can modify and use it for your own event.

You can grab the download, as well as the source, from [here][1].
