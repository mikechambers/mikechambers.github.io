[Apple][1] is rolling out its next generation OS next week, code named &#8220;[Tiger][2]&#8220;, and it is looking pretty sweet. However, as with any update this significant, there are bound to be some issues. We have put up a page listing [all know issues][3] with Macromedia products running on Tiger. Make sure to check this out before you upgrade in order to ensure that your day to day work flow is not affected.

As stated on the website, we are working with Apple to resolve these issues.
