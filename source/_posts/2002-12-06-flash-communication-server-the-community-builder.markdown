[Fusion Authority][1] has posted a report by the<!--StartFragment --><SPAN class=c1>San Antonio Macromedia and ColdFusion User Group</SPAN>&nbsp;about their experiences of using the Flash Communication Server to broadcasts their meetings over the Internet.

  
It is a very informative read, and has some good tips if you are planning on doing something similar.  
You can read the report [here][2].
