DevX has posted an article written by Jeremy Allaire, discussing Flash MX, ColdFusion MX and Rich Applications. Here is a quote:  
<!--StartFragment -->

*The idea of &#8216;Internet applications&#8217; is a slight shift from &#8216;Web applications,&#8217; reflecting the fact that while many of these applications will run in Web browsers, many will also be standalone, Internet-connected desktop applications. Many will be occasionally connected applications on laptops and wireless devices. And more and more, these applications will run with rich clients deployed in devices such as phones, PDAs, and interactive televisions. At Macromedia, we&#8217;re trying to get people to expand their definition of Internet applications beyond the notion of the document-based Web.*
