[Chafic Kazoun][1] has released a new Flash related app called Flash Tray Tools. This is a simple app that provides an easy to access menu for doing common tasks when working with Flash.

Features include:

*   Delete ASO file
*   Open personal configuration folder
*   Open personal classes folder
*   Open PrimalScript if installed
*   Open Flash MX 2004
*   Search Flashcoders
*   Search Flashcoders Wiki
*   Search Google
*   Search macromedia

You can find more information, as well as download it from [here][2].

Btw, I am working on a little tool that I am going to try to release later this week.
