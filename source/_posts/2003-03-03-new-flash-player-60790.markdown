We have released a new version of the Flash Player. The latest version for all platforms is version 6.0.79.0. This release contains a number of enhancements and bug fixes including:

*   Flash Communication Server : Audio synchronization with video has been significantly improved for live streams.
*   Flash Communication Server : management of audio delay (latency) for live streams is significantly improved.
*   Flash Communication Server : New property, liveDelay, available on the NetStream object when in live mode. This property gives an approximation of how much delay is in the audio stream as a result of varying network delays.
*   Flash Communication Server : Synchronization of audio, video and data messages during playback in a buffered stream is much more precise.
*   Time Zone Fix : Fixed invalid daylight savings time offset in the southern hemisphere.
*   Cumulative security patches.
*   Various other issues.
