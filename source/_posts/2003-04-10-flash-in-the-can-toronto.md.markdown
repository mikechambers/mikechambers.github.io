I am sorry for the lack of updates recently. I have been traveling a lot for work, and busy wrapping up the next [DevNet Resource Kit][1].

Anyways, I am going to be heading up to Toronto next week for [FlashInTheCan][2]. It is really looking likes it is going to be a great conference. If you are there, make sure to stop me and say hi.

I will be making some posts from the conference.
