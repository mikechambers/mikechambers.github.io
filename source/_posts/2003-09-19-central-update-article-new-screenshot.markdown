The Macromedia DevNet center just published an article that I wrote that gives an [update on the status of Macromedia Central][1].

The main points?

*   Release has been moved from end of summer to this fall
*   We have been fixing bugs, doing usability tests, and adding features.
*   We will be having a public developer beta within the next month.

The article also shows some new screens of the new ToolTips, and Blast! feature (which allows applications to share data with each other).

You can view the entire article [here][1].

We have also released a new screen shot to our beta. You can view the shot [here][2].

If you have any questions about Central, the article or new screenshot, you can post them in the comments, or in the [Central web forum][3].
