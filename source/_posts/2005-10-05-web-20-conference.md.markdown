Just a quick note, but I am at the O&#8217;Reilly [Web 2.0 conference][1] the rest of the week. If you are at the conference, make sure to say hi.

Kevin Lynch is giving a presentation tomorrow that I think people are going to be really excited about (can&#8217;t say too much more right now though). I&#8217;ll try to get a video of the session and post it online.

Also, sorry for the lack of posting lately. I expect that it will significantly pick up in the next couple of days / weeks.
