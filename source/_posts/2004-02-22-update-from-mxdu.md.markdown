Well, after some weekend help from Val Liberty at Macromedia (thanks for saving me again!), I finally got my dial up access working. Woohoo!. So, I will have email access throughout the week.

I got a chance to see some of the area yesterday, taking a jog around Darling harbor. Unfortunately, I ended up crashing pretty early last night, as the jet lag was finally catching up with me.

Today I am working on my [session][1] for tomorrow, and for a short stint in the [keynote][2]. I will be heading out to the Macromedia offices to work. Tonight I will be at the [National Australian user group meeting][3] which should be very cool. I am not doing any presentations, but will be answering any questions that come up about Flash or Central. I am also looking forward to meeting a lot of people.

You can see a complete list of all of the sessions I will be participating in [here][4].</p>
