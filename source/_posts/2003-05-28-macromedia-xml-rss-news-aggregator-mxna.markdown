As some of you have noticed, we have launched an [XML / RSS news aggregator][1]. The site aggregates RSS and other feeds from sites which might be useful / interesting to developers and designers who use Macromedia products.

We have created a [comprehensive FAQ][2] which has information on the aggregator, how to integrate your feed / weblog with MXNA, and how the elements of the aggregator work.

Some of the features of MXNA include:

*   Ability to Search all archived items.
*   View posted dates in your local time.
*   Easily email items to friends.
*   Quickly view and find similar sites on Google.
*   Complete support for the Blogger Ping API.
*   Record Paging.
*   Ability to filter feeds.
*   Ability to filter non RSS / XML feeds.
*   Currently over 140 feeds.
*   and more...

Note, when linking to the aggregator, please use this URL:

(you can also find a button to add to your site [here][3]).

You can view a comprehensive FAQ about the aggregator [here][2].

The aggregator is based on Geoff Bowers&#8217; awesome [fullasgoog][4] code. The [base code][5] is available on the [Macromedia DevNet Resource Kit (DRK) volume 3][6].

If you have any suggestions for the aggregator, such as new features or feeds, please send them to mxna@macromedia.com.
