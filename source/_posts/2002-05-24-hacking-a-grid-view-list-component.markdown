I was just nosing around on ultrashock&#8217;s Flash MX tutorial section, and noticed that [Branden Hall][1] has a [tutorial][2] on creating a simple Grid View component by hacking the list component.  
Waldo Smeets is also working on a more full featured data grid component, although I couldn&#8217;t find a link to it on his [site][3].
