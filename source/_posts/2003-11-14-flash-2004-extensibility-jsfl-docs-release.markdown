We have released the [complete docs][1] for the Flash MX 2004 [extensibility][2] layer. This allows you to script the authoring environment and create news tools, commands and extensions. I personally think this is the coolest and most useful feature of Flash, and I have already used it to create a [command line compiler][3] for the authoring environment.

There are a couple of extensions on [DRK 5][4] which use the extensibility layer, and you can also see a list of third party extensions [here][5].

You can view the docs on-line [here][1].

Have you had a chance to play with the extensibility yet? If so, post your thoughts and / or links in the comments section.
