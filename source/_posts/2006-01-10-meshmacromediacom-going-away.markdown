Just a quick fyi, but my mesh@macromedia.com email address is going away. It has been killed by spam and viruses. I got an email from IT last week letting me know that for that day I had received 96,000 virus emails (most of which were blocked before they got to me). Needless to say, this was a concern, and so I am having to retire the email address.

Anyways, I do still have **mesh AT adobe DOT com**, so mesh is still around. If you have my email address and need to ping me from time to time, make sure that you update your address book (unless you have a virus that is going to send emails in my name).
