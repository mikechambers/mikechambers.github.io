Just a quick note that we have done a mini update to the [Macromedia XML News Aggregator][1] (MXNA). The main change is that we have added a ranking system, which ranks items in relative to other items in the same category over the past 24 hours. 

<div align="center">

</div>

Basically, the stars represent the number of clicks an item has received relative to other items in the same category over the past 24 hours. This allows you to quickly see what the most popular items have been over the last 24 hours.

You can view the FAQ section on the ranking [here][2].
