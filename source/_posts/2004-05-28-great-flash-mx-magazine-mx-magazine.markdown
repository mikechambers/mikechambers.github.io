I just got back from the [FlashForum Konferenz][1] in Dusseldorf, Germany, which was really a greate conference. While there I picked up a copy of [MX Magazine][2], and was really impressed with the quality and quantity of articles (especially on Flash).

If you are in Europe, and you can read German (or at least fake it), I strongly suggest checking this magazine out. It is one of the best magazines (if not the best) I have seen that covers Flash topics.

You can find more info [here][2] (in German).
