ServerWatch.com has an interesting [article][1] about the Flash Communication Server. From the article:<!--StartFragment -->

  
*Naturally, Macromedia is hyping FlashCom&#8217;s &#8220;possible uses,&#8221; but we&#8217;ll list a few here because they help explain what this server is about and highlight something important about this product &#8212; its potential fecundity for new and unusual combinations of services.*  
You can read the article [here][1].
