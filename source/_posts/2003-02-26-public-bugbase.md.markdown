Over the past year, we have had a lot of requests for a public macromedia bug base. As we have mentioned before on the forums, this is something that we have been and are considering.

This leads me to my question of the day:

*Does anyone know of any other companies that have public bugbases?*

I know that most open source projects do, but can&#8217;t find any examples of other companies that have done anything similar.
