Just a quick heads up that you only have a couple of more days to submit content for the [Interaction 2003 Flash contest][1] being held by [ericd][2].

There are tons of prizes, including [DRKs][3], [Sorenson Squeeze][4], and an autographed copy of [FlashEnabled][5] that is sure to be a collectors edition!

You can view the contest site [here][1].
