One of the things that Macromedia Central makes extensive use of is the ActionScript LocalConnection object. Below is the beginning of a list of resources I have begun to put together that discuss the LocalConnection object. I figured that it might be useful for some people, so here it is.

*   [ActionScript.com Documentation][1]
*   [Using the LocalConnection feature in Macromedia Flash MX][2]
*   [Using ActionScript : LocalConnection][3]
*   [ActionScript Dictionary (Search for LocalConnection)][4]
*   [ActionScript.org tutorial on LocalConnection][5]
*   [Security Changes in Macromedia Flash Player 7 and LocalConnection][6]

If you know of any articles or resources that I missed, then post them in the comments.
