On Flash and HTML:  
*We are absolutely focussed on establishing Flash as the premier rich client. We think that people building applications will find it very compelling. Its architecture is now better suited to interactive applications and we&#8217;re making it much easier than it has been in the past to build these.*  
*However, there will be many applications where Flash is not the client. Obviously basic static content HTML is fantastic, dynamic documents are fantastic. We happened to supply the leading HTML authoring tool in the industry, so we have quite a franchise and commitment there. We expect to see a spectrum of things that people are building. We have a little chart that we&#8217;ve built that reflects this.*
