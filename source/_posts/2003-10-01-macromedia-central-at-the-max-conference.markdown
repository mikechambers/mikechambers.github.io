We have recently updated some of the sessions about [Macromedia Central][1] for the [Macromedia MAX Conference](). Here is a list of all of the Central related sessions:

*   [Deconstructing a Central Application][2] (Daniel Dura)
*   [Macromedia Central: A New Frontier for Internet Applications][3] (Macromedia)
*   [Creating your first Macromedia Central Application][4] (Phillip Kerman)
*   [Macromedia Central Application Architecture][5] (Mike Williams / Ehtan Malasky)
*   [Best Practices for Central Application Interface Design][6] (Kevin Lynch)
*   [Multi-User and Messaging Applications in Macromedia Central][7] (Mike Chambers (and a special guest?))

Or course, there are also keynotes, birds of a feature, etc... I am hoping to get some space where anyone interested in developing apps, learning about Central or just hanging around with other developers, can do so. There will be a lot of people from the Central team at the conference, so it is a good chance to get a crash course in Central from the people who made it.

The [conference][8] is November 18 &#8211; 21, in [Salt Lake City][9]. You can find more info [here][8].
