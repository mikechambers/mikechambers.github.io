Last day of Flash Forward, and it looks like it will be as busy as the previous couple of days. I am going to go to the Flash Remoting QA for Christian Cantrell&#8217;s session, I then have my session titled Rich Application Development with Flash Remoting. After that I have my QA session (I am going to miss Eric Natzke&#8217;s session ; (). In the afternoon, i am going to phillip torrone&#8217;s sessions, Fred Sharples (Star Wars in Flash: Developing for the Playstation 2), (i am not sure what session I will go to at the end.) Anyways, I am going to try to post my notes and comments. You can view them and all of my other FlashForward notes in my FlashForward section.
