The Flash community has been getting pretty excited about Flash and RSS lately. The latest (and greatest?) is Phil Chung&#8217;s [RSS Flash News feed viewer][1]. Wow, this is really nice, and makes it simple to scan a lot of information.  
Here are my feature requests:  
  
*   Once the XML is loaded, cache the data so if I click to another feed and come back it doesn&#8217;t have to reload.
  
*   When viewing one feed, load in the others and cache them.
  
*   Have it check for new feeds every 15 minutes.
  
*   Have a section that will show the top two items from every feed.
  
*   Add mesh on mx ([rss][2])!

  
Again, this is very nice, and is something that I could see myself using to keep up with all of the Flash weblogs.
