I have created a simple plugin for [Spotlight][1] search on [Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger)][2], that allows Spotlight to index ActionScript files. This will allow you to use Spotlight to search for terms / functions / code, etc within ActionScript files on your system.

<div align="center">
  <img src="/mesh/files/actionscript_spotlight/actionscript_spotlight.gif" width="372" height="340" alt="" />
</div>

NOTE, THIS CODE AND PLUGIN IS NOT SUPPORTED BY MACROMEDIA. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

This is a very Alpha version of the plugin.

You can download the plugin from [here][3].

Installation instructions are included in the readme file within the zip.

If you have any bug fixes, problems, recommendations, etc&#8230;, just post them in the comments.
