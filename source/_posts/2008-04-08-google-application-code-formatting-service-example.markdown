I was lucky enough to get an invite to the new [Google Application service beta][1], and have been playing around with it.

I just put together [a simple code formatting service application][2]. This provides an html and web service for formatting / beautifying code.

You can find complete details on the [about page for the service][2].

I will post the source in the next day or two.

Post any comments, questions, bugs or suggestions in the comments.

Update : I just uploaded the source to the app, which you can grab from the [about page][2].
