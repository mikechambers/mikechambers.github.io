The FlexUnit ActionScript 3 unit testing library has [moved to the Adobe Open Source website][1]. [Alistair Mcleod has all of the details on his blog][2], including screen shots and new info on some of the updates included in the new release (which includes a much improved test runner).

You can find all of the new FlexUnit home [here][1].
