Scott Manning of ActionScript.com has [posted][1] a report from [Mike William&#8217;s][2] session on [Macromedia Central][3] from last week&#8217;s FlashKit conference. Scott has some new information in his report, as well as a lot of screen shots.

One important tidbit that Scott pointed out is that Central will be out in the next couple of months. We are really focusing on doing this right, and making the first release of Central solid.

You can see the entire report [here][1].
