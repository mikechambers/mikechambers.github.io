We have put up demo versions of some of the Flash Applications used for the Macromedia [DevCon][1] 2002 registration.  
  
*   [DevCon 2002 Flash Registration Demo][2]
  
*   [Personal Agenda Builder Demo][2]

  
Now you can check them out without registering first. They are pretty good example of some of the advantages of using Flash for this type of form based application.  
Also, don&#8217;t forget that early bird registration for [DevCon][1] end son August 27th. If you register before then, you can save $155. I will be at the conference talking about Flash Remoting and Flash Security.
