Just a quick reminder, but the [on AIR Bus][1] has rolled into [Philadelphia][1] today, and we will be holding an AIR Camp event tonight. I will be speaking, along with the rest of the the [bus crew][2].

We will have plenty of food, beer, code, schwag and other goodness, so [if you are in Philly, make sure to stop by][1].

Btw, where is the best place to get a cheesesteak in Philly? We just hit [Pat&#8217;s][3], where should we go after the event?
