Just a quick reminder, but I will be out at [Apollo Ranch in Boulder, Colorado][1] this weekend. I will be giving the keynote, as well as a getting started session.

I am planning to give a sneak peak of the upcoming public beta, so if you are in the area make sure to hurry up and sign up (spaces are running out).

You can find more information [here][1].
