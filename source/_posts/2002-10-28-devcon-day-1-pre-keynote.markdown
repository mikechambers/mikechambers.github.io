Just wanted to give a heads up that I will be blogging the keynote in real-time. My plan is to publish my notes live during the keynote, and then afterwords go back and clean them up. So if you couldn&#8217;t make DevCon, you can find out what we are talking about right away. If i have a chance, I&#8217;ll try to do a video blog (vlog?) of part of the keynote.  
Also, I will be posting all of the DevCon related into in the DevCon section of my weblog. I don&#8217;t believe I will be pushing all of those updates on the main page.  
You can find the DevCon section [here][1].  
Btw, you can find some more DevCon coverage at [JD&#8217;s][2] site, as well as [vernon&#8217;s][3], [matt&#8217;s][3], [sean&#8217;s][4] and [jeremy&#8217;s][5] weblogs.  
BTW2, I will doing some video reports, so if there is anyone you want to hear from, or have any questions for anyone, post them in the comments.  
BTW3, the&nbsp;[Designer and Developer center][6]&nbsp;will be posting highlights on the main page of DevCon weblog coverage.
