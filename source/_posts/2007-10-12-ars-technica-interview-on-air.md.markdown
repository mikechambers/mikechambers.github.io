[ars technica][1] has an [interview up with Ed Finkler][1], the developer behind the AIR based [Spaz Twitter client][2] (which was one of the winners of the [AIR Developer Derby][3]).

The interview is a good read and why Ed (an HTML / PHP developer) choose AIR, and what his experience was like working with the runtime. It also gives a good explanation of some of the new [HTML / JavaScript security changes][4] that were implimented in [Beta 2][5].

You can read the entire article [here][1].
