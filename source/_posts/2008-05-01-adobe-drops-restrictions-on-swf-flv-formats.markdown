As you have probably seen, [Adobe has dropped the licensing restrictions on both the SWF and FLV file formats][1]. Among other things, you can know use the formats to create players that read in the formats.

Check out Ryan Stewart&#8217;s weblog for more [discussion][2]

We have also put up a [site with some information][1], which includes a [FAQ][3].

You can also download the specs:

*   [SWF 9][4]
*   [FLV][5]
*   [AMF Specification][6]
