I have seen a lot of people talking about problems when viewing the new [Macromedia.com website Beta][1] within the [Opera][2] browser.

We are aware of the issues and are working with Opera to resolve it.

Btw, this is one of the reasons the new site is a &#8220;Beta&#8221;. We are still working out some of the kinks. If you find any problems, or have any feedback, make sure to log it on the [Macromedia.com feedback form][3].
