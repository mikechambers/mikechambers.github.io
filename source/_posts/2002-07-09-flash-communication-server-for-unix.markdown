There have been a lot of questions about the availability of the Flash Communication Server on Unix. Currently, it is only available for Windows servers, but we will be releasing Unix versions later in the year.  
Make sure to send which Unix flavor you prefer to the [wish list][1]. This will help us to prioritize the work.
