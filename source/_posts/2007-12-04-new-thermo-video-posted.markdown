The edge has just posted a [video interview][1] with Mark Anders and Steven Heinz (both from the Thermo team). In the video, Mark and Steve give an [introduction to and overview of Thermo][1].

What is Thermo? From the labs page:

> &#8220;Thermo&#8221; is an upcoming Adobe product that makes it easy for designers to create rich Internet application UIs. Thermo allows designers to build on familiar workflows to visually create working applications that easily flow into production and development.

You can view the entire video [here][1].

You can find more information on [Thermo on labs][2].
