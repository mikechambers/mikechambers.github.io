I just landed in Amsterdam and made it to my hotel. As much as I want to go for a nice stroll and eat some herring and lekkerbeckies, I have to hang around here and finish up my presentation (I couldn&#8217;t plugin my laptop on the flight). I will be speaking tonight at the inaugural meeting of the [Amsterdam Macromedia User Group][1], so if you happen to be in the Netherlands, make sure to drop by.

You can find more info on the meeting tonight [here][1].

Btw, I will be in London tomorrow night for the London Macromedia User Group meeting (along with Grant Skinner, Arul Balkan, Peter Hall, Owen Van Dijk and Guy Watson). You can find more info on that meeting [here][2].
