I am finally in Salt Lake city for the [Max conference][1]. Unfortunately, I have a ton of work to do, so I have been holed up in my room all night. 

[Danny Dura][2] and [Christian Cantrell][3] are also hanging around and we are working on some pretty cool stuff. More info soon.

I&#8217;ll be posting pictures on the [Vision][4] website that Christian made (hmm... that sure would make a good Central app... ;) ).
