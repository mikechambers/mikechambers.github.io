I have just uploaded a [video of some of the Flash 10 Year Anniversary party][1] from last night (held at Adobe / former Macromedia HQ in San Francisco).

The clip includes birthday wishes from [Strongbad][2], and [Nectarine][3] and some comments from Kevin Lynch and the guys from [Big Spaceship][4].

You can view the complete video [here][1].

Highlights of the night included a birthday greeting for Flash from [Strong bad][2], Flashtinis, and Halo into the night.

You can find more info on the anniversary and history of Flash [here][5].

Sorry about the crappy quality.
