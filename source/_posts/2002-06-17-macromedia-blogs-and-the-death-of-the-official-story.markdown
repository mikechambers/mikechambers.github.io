Another interesting [read][1] on the Macromedia weblogs, and corporate blogging in general. This one focuses on the importance of trustworthiness in marketing on the Internet.  
One quick correction to the article, the weblogs were an initiative of the community managers (mostly [JD&#8217;s][2] idea); we were not asked by Macromedia to create them. Although that may seem like a subtle correction, I wanted to make it clear that we were / are not required to maintain the weblogs. However, at least in the case of this weblog, I enjoy it, and it makes my job much, much easier.
