I came across some of the Flash related entries at [wikipedia][1] this weekend, and, as I know a bit about Flash, I began to correct and add some info. However, as I thought about it, I realized that some people might not like the fact that I, a [Macromedia][2] employee, was editing and contributing to Macromedia related entries. I was concerned that people would be concerned that since I was from macromedia that any info I added would display a bias.

I have tons of info I could contribute (especially about past versions of Flash), but before I do, I wanted to get some thoughts about my contributing.

So:

Can I contribute to Flash related entries at wikipedia?

Specifically, I have been watching the [ActionScript][3], [Macromedia Flash][4], and [Macromedia Flash Player][5] entries (I created the Flash Player entry). I understand concerns about potential abuse or bias, but it seems to me that one of the strengths of wikipedia is that any misinformation can be quickly corrected. So what are you thoughts? Anyone know of any other companies contributed to entries that they have an interest in?

You can view my list of contributions [here][6].

Btw, if you are not sure what wikipedia is, you can find a good article discussing it [here][7] and can find some more info [here][8].

Post any thoughts in the comments section.
