Well, since I began playing around with the [Flash Communication Server][1], I have been missing a lot of sleep. As I [posted earlier][2], I created a simple Flash chat application, that included text and video chat.  
Well today, I figured out how to get the Flash Player to think the SVideo in on my laptop is a camera. So I was able to stream me playing Halo on the Xbox to every one in the chat room (about 6 or 7 people).  
Here are some pictures [1][3], [2][4], [3][5], [4][6], [5][7], [6][8].  
Btw, I have still not had to write any ActionScript code for the application.
