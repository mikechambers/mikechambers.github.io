I am currently putting together my [DevCon][1] session on Flash Security and am also considering updating the [Flash MX Security Whitepaper][2]. I am looking for some input on the following:  
What topics do would you like to have covered in the presentation? What needs to be added / updated in the security whitepaper?  
Post you suggestions in the comments section.
