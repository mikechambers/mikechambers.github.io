We have published a new tutorial about localizing Flash movies using Macromedia Flash MX. This tutorial covers the entire localization process using Macromedia Flash MX. Topics include Unicode support in the authoring tool and Macromedia Flash Player 6, strategies and recommended practices to prepare your files for localization and use with translation memory software, and analysis of a sample file that loads external XML files containing five different languages.  
You can view the tutorial [here][1].
