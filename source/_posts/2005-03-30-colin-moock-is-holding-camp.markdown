Just noticed this, but [Colin Moock][1] (author of [Essential ActionScript 2.0][2]) is doing a couple of [ActionScript bootcamps][3] in May and June. If you want to learn ActionScript from the master, or take your skills to the next level, this is the perfect opportunity.

Colin will be doing sessions in Toronto, Los Angeles and Rochester, NY. You can find more information, including content and dates [here][3].
