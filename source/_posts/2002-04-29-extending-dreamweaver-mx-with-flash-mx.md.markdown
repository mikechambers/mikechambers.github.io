Neil Clark has created a Dreamweaver MX [extension][1] that utilized XML and Flash MX to add functionality to Dreamweaver MX.<!--StartFragment -->

  
*It was designed from the outset to not only fit into the style of Dreamweaver MX, but to allow a once-only download of the Panel which could be extented by the end-user by creating a new dictionary definition of anything they choose in the Panel&#8217;s declared XML format, which in turn will show up automatically in the Panel.*
