Ely Greenfield has put together a cool Flex 2 [FishEye menu component][1] (complete with source).

Ely discusses how he is try to show the type of expressive content that can be built with Flex:

> One important goal with this component, as with a bunch of things I&#8217;ve been working on lately, is to help the community see how you can merge the best of what flex gives you (productivity, development process, consistent component model) with the best of what people have been doing in flash for years (rich, highly interactive, fluid, etc). The SDK&#8217;s GUI components provide a lot of value, but they&#8217;re really just the tip of the iceberg of what&#8217;s possible with Flex. Hopefully these kinds of demos whet your appetite.

You can find more information, as well as view the example and download the source from [here][1].
