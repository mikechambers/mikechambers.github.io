I am going to be giving [a presentation on Apollo this Thursday at the Washington DC Adobe User Group meeting][1]. I will be giving an overview of Apollo, shows some apps, show how to build a simple app, and answer any questions anyone might have.

You can find more information on the user group site [here][1].
