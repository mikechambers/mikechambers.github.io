With the ton of announcements yesterday about [DevNet Subscriptions][1], [FreeHand MX][2] and Studio MX Plus, I forgot that we also released some new Flash MX resources on the new [DevNet center][3].

*   [Developing Multiplayer Minesweeper : Brian Lesser][4]
*   [Creating your First Flash Communication Server Broadcast : Giacomo Guilizzoni][5]
*   [Precision Drawing with Macromedia Flash MX and FreeHand MX : Bently Wolfe][6]
*   [Building Product Simulations with Macromedia Flash MX : Jonathon Kaye][7]

We also launched the new [FreeHand MX Development center][8] which has a cool article on how to [make your own Macromedia rune][9] with FreeHand MX.
