OK. As many of you have noticed, some of our [DRK][1] marketing materials use some pictures of me. You can see some examples on the [macromedia home page][2] (you may have to reload it a couple of time) as well as [here][3], [here][4] and [here][5].

Well, I don&#8217;t know what to say except that marketing made me do it! Anyways, I have already seen a couple of spoofs, so I figured I would roll with it. So, I am going to hold a contest for the best spoof of the DRK ads. The winner will receive a copy of [DRK 3][1].

Just send the link to your spoof directly to me at: <mesh@macromedia.com> or post it in the comments. I&#8217;ll post the finalist, and then I (along with a few other judges) will pick the winner. The deadline is next Monday, April 28 at 5 pm est.
