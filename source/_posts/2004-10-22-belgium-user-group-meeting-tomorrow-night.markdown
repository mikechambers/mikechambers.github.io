I have been in Paris all week for the [Macromedia France MAX conference][1]. The conference was great and I got to meet a ton of super talented Flash designers and developers. I sent a couple of pictures from my SideKick over to the [vision site][2].

I will be speaking at the [Belgium User group][3] meeting tomorrow (Saturday night) in Mechelem (just north of Brussels). Aral Balkan will also be speaking, so it should be a pretty good meeting. If you happen to be in Belgium, make sure to come by the meeting. If you are lucky, you might get to hear me speak some Dutch.
