Slashdot posted an [article][1] with concerns about privacy and security in the Flash player due to the players access to a user&#8217;s camera, microphone and its ability to store data (via shared objects). Below is some information and links which will hopefully dispel some of the misperceptions in the original article and in some of the comments attached to the article  
The Camera and Microphone access defaults to off. Anytime that a Flash movie tries to access the camera or microphone the user will be asked to allow or deny the access. The access is domain based.  
The Shared Objects are very similar to cookies, the main difference being that you can store entire ActionScript objects, and they can be used with Flash projectors (they don&#8217;t require a web browser).
