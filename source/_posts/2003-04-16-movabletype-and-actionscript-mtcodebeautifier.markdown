I just installed Sean Voisen&#8217;s MovableType plugin, MTCodeBeautifier and it works like a charm.

You can see it in action [here][1].

You can find more information on it [here][2].

Now we just need a ColdFusion syntax file ; )

The only thing I can&#8217;t figure out is how to have it not strip the whitespace from my code. It messes up my indenting. If anyone has any suggestions, post them in the comments.

Props to Sean for putting this together.
