I am sorry that I have not been as active online the past week and a half (including blogging and podcasts). I have been swamped at work playing around with some new stuff (more on that later).

Anyways, I wanted to post a couple of links that caught my eye over the past week or so:  
<!--more-->

  
[Ryan Stewart at Digital Backcountry][1] &#8211; Make sure to check out Ryan&#8217;s weblog. I think he has some of the best commentary anywhere on the RIA space. Apparently I am not the only one who has been noticing this, as ZDNET has asked him to do [a blog on RIAs][2] on their site.

Webmonkey posted [a good tutorial on using the Flex &#8211; Ajax Bridge][3] that Ely Greenfield put together.

Sean Moore has put together a new site where he is posting [ActionScript 3 Cheatsheets][4]. (These are sweet!)

[Ted Patrick has join Adobe][5] as a Flex Evangilist.

ABC launches their free online [Flash based video service / player][6]. You can find some more commentary and information [here][7] and [here][8].
