Just a quick note, but it looks like [a bug in Firefox 3][1] (soon to be released) will break some existing Flash content. Specifically, it looks like it breaks onKeyUp events in Flash.

You can find more info, and view the bug [here][1].

<strike>Unfortunately, it does not look like they will fix this for the 3.0 release, but may fix it in the first 3.0 update.</strike>

UPDATE : Mozilla decided to fix the issue (woot!), and [has posted a new build][2]. Make sure to check out the build and test your content.
