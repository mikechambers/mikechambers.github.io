Sorry for the lack of update recently. I was in Japan for a week with the Flash team [meeting with customers about 8ball][1]. After that, I took all of last week off to catch up on some reading, video game playing, and hanging around with my daughter.

If you sent me and email during the past week, I may not have been able to respond yet. Don&#8217;t worry though, I am starting to catch up on emails. Also, one of our filter servers went down, so if you sent me a mail, you may have received a message that it bounced. Don&#8217;t worry, I still got your email, as it didn&#8217;t bounce from the main mail server.
