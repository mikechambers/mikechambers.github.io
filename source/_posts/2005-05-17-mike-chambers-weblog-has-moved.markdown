As you have probably noticed, my weblog has moved from markme.com to weblogs.macromedia.com.

The new url is:

<http://www.mikechambers.com/mesh/>

Make sure to update your urls for the site and the [rss][1] feeds.

Christian Cantrell&#8217;s weblog has also moved, and eventually all of the weblogs on markme.com will be transitioned over.

The biggest changes are that the site has a new look (although not necessarily good). I tweaked the default templates, so they don&#8217;t look so hot, but I am going to try to spiff it up some over the coming weeks.

The other big change is that we are using a new spam controll system, which should hopefully reduce or eliminate weblog spam.

Finally, we have tried to redirect everything from markme.com, but there are probably quite a few links and posts still broken. So, if you find any errors, you can just post them in the comments here.

Updated : April 23, 2007 to point to new domain.
