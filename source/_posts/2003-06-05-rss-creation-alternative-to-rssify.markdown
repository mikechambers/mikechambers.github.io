If you were using the RSSify service (not to be confused with [RSSify on DRK 3][1]) to generate your RSS feed for your site, you have probably noticed that it is [no longer working][2].

[Navneet][3] points out a similar service at [Blogstreet][4], which will allow you to once again begin publishing RSS feeds.

You can find more info [here][4].

If you do change the URL to your feed, make sure to submit the change to <mxna@macromedia.com> in order to ensure that MXNA continues to aggregate it.
