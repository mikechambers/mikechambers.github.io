This is just a quick update to the post i made last Tuesday on the [Flash MX Certified Developer exam][1]. We have updated the site with a [chart][2] showing the classes leading up to the exams. Of course, the classes are not required but they can give you an idea of the skill set needed for the exams.  
So, this leads me to the question of the day (or week):  
**What do you think of the Macromedia Flash Certification Exams? Do you plan to take them? Why or why not?**  
My personal opinion is that they can be useful as they show that you have a certain base level of knowledge about Flash (which can help you stand out among other developers). Since there is no downside to having certification and potential big upside, they are a good thing to have. (of course, they are not a replacement for real world knowledge and skills).
