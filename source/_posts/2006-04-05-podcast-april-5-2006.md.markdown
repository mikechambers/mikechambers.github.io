As I [mentioned last week][1], I decided to start up a new podcast. Christian and I had done a couple of [podcasts][2] together last year, but as they took too much time to produce, we ended up not having time to do very many. My podcast will be a little less polished, but hopefully I will be able to do them a little more consistently.

I have just uploaded the first podcast.
