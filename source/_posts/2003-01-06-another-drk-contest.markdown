I am planning on holding another &#8220;Find Cartoon Mesh&#8221; DRK contest similar to the run i ran last [week][1]. However, this time, Cartoon Mesh (or should it be mini-mesh) will be hidden on my blog or one of the other Flash related weblogs.  
So, if you run a weblog and want to participate in the contest, just send me an email directly, or post your link in the comments section. I&#8217;ll&nbsp; get all of the links together, and then start the contest.  
Also, if you get tired of looking for Cartoon Mike, submit a new character to search for.  
The prize will be a copy of the [Developer Resource Kit][2] Volume 2.
