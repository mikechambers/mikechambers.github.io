Well, last week was the &#8220;[What do you want in the next version of Flash question][1]&#8220;. Since things are still pretty quiet this week, here is a new question:  
**What new components would you like to see made available?**  
FYI : We will be making a DataGrid component available very soon, so you don&#8217;t have to list that.  
Post your thoughts in the comments section.
