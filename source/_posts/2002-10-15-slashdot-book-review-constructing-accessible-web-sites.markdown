[Slashdot][1] has just posted a book [review][2] of [Constructing Accessible Web Sites][3]&nbsp;(book excerpts at Amazon). The book includes a chapter on Flash on which the reviewer offers the following:  
*I was surprised that chapter 10 was devoted to Flash, as I expected that Flash coverage in an accessibility book would be limited to a few paragraphs lambasting Macromedia for creating such an inaccessible technology. Well, it turns out that the new version of Flash supports accessibility much better than previous ones. This chapter was a real eye-opener for me. Clearly there is more work to be done but well done to Macromedia for putting accessibility support in!*  
You can read the entire review, and comments [here][2].
