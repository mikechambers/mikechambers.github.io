[Meg Hourihan][1] has an article on O&#8217;Reilly today titled:  
  
*   [Blogging For Dollars : Giving Rise to the Professional Blogger][2]

  
She mentions the Macromedia weblogs, and suggests that companies should hire full time webloggers.  
What are your thoughts? What do you think of the Macromedia weblogs? What would you like for us to do differently? Do we need a full time weblogger? Should the weblogs be on Macromedia.com? Does it matter?
