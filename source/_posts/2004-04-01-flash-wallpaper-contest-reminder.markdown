Just a quick reminder that the [Flash Desktop wallpaper contest][1] ends tomorrow at 5pm PST (-8:00 UTC). There have already been nearly 100 submissions, but there is still time to submit more.

What can you win? How about an Xbox or Timbuk2 Flash messenger bag.

You can find more info on the contest, as well as submit your submissions [here][1].
