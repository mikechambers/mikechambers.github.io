Mark Anders has made a [post][1] detailing some of the new features that have been added to Flex Builder 2 internal builds recently.

Features / changes includes:  
<!--more-->

*   In place label editing in design view</p> 
    *   Guides and Snapping in design view
    *   Auto Import for classes that are used (use a class and it automatically adds the import statement).
    *   MXML and ActionScript Outline view (I gave a sneak of this at [SparkEurope][2])
    *   Code collapse (finally!)
    *   Auto-add ASDocs comments
    *   block-commenting / uncommenting
    *   pop-up outline with quick view
    *   improved debugger variable display
    *   E4X support in the debugger (so you can use the debugger to move through E4X / XML objects.</ul> 
    Another thing that is in this build, but that Mark didn&#8217;t mention was improved compile times. Incremental compile time have been significantly improved. We are still working on compiler performance, but just this single change makes a HUGE difference.
    
    Expect to see all of these features (and more) in the next public beta release of Flex Builder 2. You can grab the current beta from [Macromedia Labs][3].
    
    Check out [Mark&#8217;s post for more details][1]. He also discusses some of the new Flex Framework work being done.
