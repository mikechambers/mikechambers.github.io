I just noticed that we have posted some new Apollo articles on labs.

*   [Using HTML in Flex based Apollo Applications][1] Edward Mansouri
*   [Working with Binary Data in Apollo][2] Ben Stucki
*   [Taking Apollo Applications Offline][3] John Bland II

You can view all of the articles, as well as the rest of the Apollo alpha documentation on the [Apollo documentation section on labs][4].
