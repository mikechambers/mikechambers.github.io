[Christian Cantrell][1] just posted that Jeremy Allaire will be moving on to tackle some new challenges. Jeremy has made a [post][2] to his weblog talking about the changes, and looking back at some of the successes he has helped drive at Macromedia.

Jeremy will continue to work closely with Macromedia as a *Macromedia Founder Emeritus*.

You can read Jeremy&#8217;s post [here][2].

On a personal note, I think that Jeremy is truly one of the pioneers of web application development, and I wish him the best of luck.
