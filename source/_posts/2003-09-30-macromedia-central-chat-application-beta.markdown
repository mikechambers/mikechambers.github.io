I have been working on using the [chat framework][1] that [Greg Burch][2] and I put together to build a simple chat application for [Macromedia Central][3]. I is not complete, but I figured that people might be interested in checking it out.

You can install it using the install badge on the right (just click install).

I will be hanging around in the chat most of the day and will be chatting and answering questions about Central.

I will also be updating it though the week, so you can either manually check from within Central (Central Dev Chat > Check for Updates), or Central will periodically check for you.

You can access the preferences for the chat from Central Dev Chat > Preferences.

Biggest Known issues:

*   If you do not send a message for an extended period of time, the chat will disconnected.
*   The close icon in the preferences and command window does not work.
*   The chat input field will sometimes not enable. If this happens, disconnect, switch to another app and back to the chat.

I plan to write an article discussing the application architecture, and posting the code on the [DevNet][4] site.

If you find any bugs, or have any suggestions, post them in the comments.
