We launched our new website site last week, and as I am sure most people in the community know, it generated quite a lot of discussion. Well, we were listening. We took the feedback (from the community, survey, feedback forms, and talking to directly to users), tweaked the site, and have released [a new version of the website][1]. The new home page is a hybrid site combining HTML and Flash, has a more straight forward navigation scheme, and loads much quicker now.

We learned a ton of things from the first week of the beta, and while everything didn&#8217;t work out as we had planned, we decided the information was too valuable to keep to ourselves. We have put together a [report about what we learned from the first stage of the beta][2]. The report outlines what worked (the exchanges) and what didn&#8217;t (the home page), and provides detailed information, statistics and survey results about the website&#8217;s first week.

You can view the report [here][2].

Some of the interesting info you can find from the report:

*   Connection speed did not influence how people rated their experience on the site.
*   Processor speed did influence how people rated the site.
*   The number of downloads on the exchange doubled.
*   Customer satisfaction for the Rich Internet Applications on the site were generally high.
*   Very few users used any of the advanced navigation on the home page (less than 5%).

Is the new site perfect? Not yet. We are still working on improving it. If you have any comments or suggestions, let us know about them through the [feedback form][3], and / or [survey][4].
