As we [announced][1] a couple of months ago, we are working on a next generation IDE based on Eclipse (code-named [Zorn][2]), focused on application development using the Flex Framework. We have been talking to a lot of developers about what features they would like to see in Zorn, and so I wanted to make a quick post to allow the wider development community to put in their two cents worth.

So, what features would you like to see in Zorn?
