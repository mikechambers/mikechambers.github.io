We have made some updates to the [Macromedia XML News Aggregator][1]. We have implemented a number of feed filters, which should hopefully make the categories more on-topic, and ensure that websites and feeds that span categories, have their individual posts show up in the appropriate category.

Over the coming weeks, you may notice that all of your posts don&#8217;t show up, or they show up in different categories (depending on what you post about). If something seems to end up in the wrong place, then please let us [know about it][2].

We have added an item to the FAQ with some [more information][3].

You can view the Macromedia XML News Aggregator (MXNA) [here][1].
