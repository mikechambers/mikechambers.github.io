We have finality picked the winners for the [Flash Desktop Wallpaper Contest][1]. There were over 150 submissions(!) and it was tough picking the winners from all of them. I picked out 10 finalists, and then the Flash team voted on their top three.

Anyways, here are the winners in order:

3.  <http://www.tiszanet.hu/varkonyi/theMXman/theMXman_800x.jpg>

If you are one of the winners, send me an email (<mesh@macromedia.com>) so I can send out your prizes.

Thanks to everyone who participated. We were really blown away by the quality of the submissions.
