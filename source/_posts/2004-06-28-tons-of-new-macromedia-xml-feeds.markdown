We have made a ton of new Macromedia XML feeds available in order to make it easier for everyone to keep up with the latest news, technotes, articles and other information from Macromedia.

Here is a list of some of the products covered:

*   Breeze
*   Central
*   ColdFusion
*   Contribute
*   Director
*   Dreamweaver
*   Flash Communication Server
*   Fireworks
*   Flash
*   Flash Player
*   Flash Remoting
*   Flex
*   FreeHand
*   JRun

You can find out more information, as well as view all of the feed URLs from:  
<http://www.macromedia.com/go/rss_info>

Christian also has some additional information on the feeds [here][1].

You can also keep up with all of the feeds in the Macromedia category at [MXNA][2].

Btw, big thanks to [Christian Cantrell][3] who basically put the entire project together.
