I just posted on the on AIR Bus Tour weblog that we have [opened up the code repository for the tour][1]. We will be posting all of the applications for the tour here and have already included two:

*   AIRSnapshot Application: AIR application that takes a picture from the webcam, geoencodes it and uploads to Flickr.
*   AIRTracker Application: AIR application which takes geo-coordinates, maps then, and uploads them to a server API

You can find more information over at the [on AIR Tour weblog][1].
