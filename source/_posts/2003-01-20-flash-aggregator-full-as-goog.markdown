[Full as Goog][1] has had a bunch of updates this weekend. They added a number of new weblogs, and are publishing aggregated XML RSS feeds.

You can find more info on the specific updates [here][2] and visit the site [here][1].

You can view all of the latest news in the Macromedia / Flash / ColdFusion / Dreamweaver worlds here.

This is quickly becoming one of my favorite aggregators.
