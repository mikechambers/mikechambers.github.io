As you may or may not have seen, a couple of designers have released some Central desktop wallpapers. Even cooler, is that some of them even released their Photoshop sources files so anyone can modify them:

Anyways, I haven&#8217;t had a contest since the &#8220;Spoof Mike Chambers&#8221; contest, so I figured I would hold another one. So, here is the deal, I am holding a contest for the coolest Central related desktop wallpaper. Here are the rules:
