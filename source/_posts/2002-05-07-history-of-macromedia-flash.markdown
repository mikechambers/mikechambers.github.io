As you may or may not know, this year is Macromedia&#8217;s 10th birthday. In celebration, i did a quick search to see what information i could find on the history of Macromedia and Flash. Here is what i found:  
  
*   [Macromedia Survives a Decade by Reinventing itself][1]&nbsp;[via [JD on MX][2]]  
    *   [The History of Flash][3] (written by the creator of Flash)  
        *   [The History of Flash][4] (slightly older version)  
            *   [Macromedia Timeline][5]  
                *   [Flash Tutorial for Beginners][6] (has brief history outline)  
                    *   [The development of Flash][7] (in Dutch, has screenshots of all versions) [thanks&nbsp;[waldo][8]]  
                        *   [The Flash History][9] (flashmagazine) [thanks [jarle][10]]  
                            *   Web Archives ([futurewave][11]) | ([macromedia][12])</UL>
                              
                            I also thought that Flash developers might be interesting in seeing some pictures of Macromedia headquarters, the Flash Team offices, and some of the members of the Flash Team.  
                            You can view the pictures [here][13].</p>
