We announced today the release and availability of [FreeHand MX][1]. The version offers tons of new features and functionality including improved Flash integration:

*Increase productivity and streamline development of Macromedia Flash MX projects. Plan, layout and design entire projects in single document. Now you can even import more complex Macromedia Flash movies (SWFs) into your FreeHand MX document and integrate them into your designs before exporting back out to SWF with improved efficiency. Placed SWFs can be edited using the new launch and edit in Macromedia Flash MX functionality. Macromedia Flash MX can also open and import FreeHand MX files.*
