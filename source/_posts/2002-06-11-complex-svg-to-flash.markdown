Helen Triolo has written an [article][1] showing how to render complex (very complex) SVG drawings in the Flash Player using the ActionScript drawing API.  
This is by far the most impressive SVG to Flash Player work I have seen to date, and as you would expect from Helen, it is all documented very well.
