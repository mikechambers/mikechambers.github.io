Greg Burch and I have been working on a new framework for multiuser applications with the Flash Communication Server.  
We have put up a pre-alpha version of a chat using the framework which you can view and use [here][1].  
The page includes info on how to get involved as well as how to submit bugs and suggestions.  
Finally, this is pre-alpha and it by far not bug free or feature complete. In fact, the basic architecture on the server still needs a lot of work.
