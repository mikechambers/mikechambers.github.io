Wow! Things have been crazy the past couple of weeks. There have been a ton of [announcements][1] coming out of Max. I am too tired right now to list all of them, or point out the ton of new Central related content on the website, but I did want to point that we have released the &#8220;[Developer Release][2]&#8221; of Central today.

What exactly is the Developer Release, and what does it mean? The Developer Release means that Central is ready for developers to start making applications. The API is stable and the [SDK][3] is complete. The licenses are final, and you can get all of the license types (including try / buy).

In a word, it means &#8220;GO!&#8221;.

I will post more info on all of the news in the morning. I think I should sleep now. In the meantime, check out [CentralMX.com][4] which is keeping up with all of the latest news and announcements.
