This is an open letter to whoever keeps sending e-mail to <wish-flash@macromedia.com> advertising illegal cracked versions of our products (Flash MX, Dreamweaver MX, etc...) for sale.  
  
1.  Thank you, but we already have legal copies.
  
2.  If it is not too much trouble, please send your inquiries to <tip@macromedia.com>, as that will save us some time forwarding your email (they will be very interested in your &#8220;business&#8221;).

  
Btw, if you are looking for a Flash MX Crack, or Dreamweaver MX Crack, then just send a request [here][1].
