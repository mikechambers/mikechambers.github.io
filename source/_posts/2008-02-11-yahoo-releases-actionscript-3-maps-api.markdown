[Ted Patrick][1] has just posted that [Yahoo has released an ActionScript 3 API for their online maps API][2]. I havent had a chance to play with it yet, but all of the comments I have seen thus far suggest that it is blazing fast.

You can find more information, as well as download the API from [here][2].
