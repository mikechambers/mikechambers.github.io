We have just released the initial version of Macromedia Flex and have updated the website with tons of information, including a new [Flex Developer Center][1] and an updated [Flex product page][2].

I have also put together a Breeze presentation that talks about [what Flex means for Flash developers and designers][3]. Summary? While Flex is definitely targeted at developers who have not been able to use / understand the Flash authoring tool in the past, it does offer some potential opportunities for current Flash developers and designers.

Nigel Pegg has also put together a great article describing his take on Flex from the perspective of a Flash developer. You can view his article [here][4].

We have also added a [Flex category][5] to the Macromedia XML News Aggregator (MXNA).

I am really excited about Flex. While I won&#8217;t be using it much (I already know how to do this stuff in Flash authoring), I think it has the potential to really expand the reach of Flash rich applications to a new class of developers. This can only help expand and grow the Flash platform.

You can view my Breeze presentation [here][3].
