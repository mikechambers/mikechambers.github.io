At FlashForward in San Francisco two weeks ago we announced the new version of the Macromedia Flash Communication Server (1.5). However, it got lost in all of the excitement and discussion about Macromedia Central.

Some of the new features in 1.5 include:

*   HTTP Tunneling
*   SSL Support
*   Linux Version
*   Support for loading and streaming mp3s

There is also now a [free developers version][1] which does not timeout.

Upgrades from 1.0 are free for Professional Edition users, and $99 for Personal Edition users.

Phillip Kerman has written a really good article on the new features which you can read [here][2].

You can find more information on the Flash Communication Server at the:

*   [Flash Communication Server Product Page][3]
*   [Flash Communication Server Development Center][4]
