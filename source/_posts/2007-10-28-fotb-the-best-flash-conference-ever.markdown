I am heading over to Europe in about a week for [Flash on the Beach][1] (FOTB) (and the [European user group tour][2]), and was checking out the [speaker list for FOTB][3].

It is pretty amazing, which brought the following question to mind&#8221;

Is this going to be the best Flash conference ever?
