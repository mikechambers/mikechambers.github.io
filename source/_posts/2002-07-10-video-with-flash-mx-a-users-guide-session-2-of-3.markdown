Short QA session.  
They are showing comparisons of the same video in different players (austin powers trailer):  
  
*   Real Player 225k low badwidth. pretty good quality. (watch scene changes and transitions.) streaming.  
    *   Windows Media Player : pretty good quality. streaming.  
        *   Quicktime : good quality. alittle choppy, good encoding.  
            *   Flash MX : Good quality. low badwidth. comparable to other formats.</UL>
              
            In higher end encoding, the differences between the players become more obvious, with dedicate video players having better quality.  
            Encoding time:  
              
            *   Flash : fast  
                *   Quicktime : slow</UL>
                  
                FileSize  
                  
                *   Quicktime 4.56 megs  
                    *   Windows medi : 4.54 megs  
                        *   Flash 4.51 megs</UL>
                          
                        When deciding which video codec to use, dont just think of penetration stats today, but think of where it will be in 6 months to a year.  
                        they are shhowing a seinfeld video player, where you pick a character, and the can choose from a number of clips from the show (george has shrinkage). they keep track of how many videos you have watched. every four videos you watch, you have to watch a commerical (they showed a vw jetta commercial). You can play a new video until the entire commerical has run.  
                        QA.  
                        end of session.</p>
