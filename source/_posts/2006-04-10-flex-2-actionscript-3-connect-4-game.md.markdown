Je Berkovitz has put together a [connect 4 game using Flex 2 and ActionScript 3][1]. This version allows you to play against the computer, and I have to say, the computer is pretty tough (I haven&#8217;t been able to beat it yet).

You can find more information, as well as play the game [here][1].

Post in the comments if you are actually able to win a game.
