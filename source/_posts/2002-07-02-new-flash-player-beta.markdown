We have released a new Flash Player beta, codenamed [Airwolf][1]. This is a developer only beta, and we are making it available it order to get any feedback or issues from the developer community. There is only a small turn time on this tech beta so your feedback in a quick and timely manner is much appreciated.

Update : The beta is now closed and the new player has been released. You can find information about it [here][2].  
New features / fixes include:  
  
*   Masking Device Fonts  
    *   Accessing ID3 properties in MP3 files with the Airwolf Player  
        *   Flash scriptability (XPCom/LiveConnect) support for Netscape  
            *   Text fields are now more efficient and consume less memory  
                *   Intel P4 optimizations </UL></p>
