[Dave Yang][1] has posted a ton of photos from the [Flash in the Can][2] conference.

Of particular interest are two photos from [Josh Davis&#8217;s][3] presentation outline some useful tips for doing some cool stuff with Flash.

[Ripping large amounts of shapes and colors for use in ActionScript][4]

[Capturing ActionScript Programs for Print][5]

You can view all of the pictures [here][6].

Btw, I had a great time at the conference this week. I want to thanks Shawn Pucknell and crew for putting on such an amazing conference. I am already looking forward to the conference for next year.
