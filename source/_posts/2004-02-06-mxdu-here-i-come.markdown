I am going to be heading down to Sydney in a couple of weeks for the [MXDU conference][1]. It is shaping up to be an awesome conference with some of the [top developers in the world][2].

I will be doing a session and a birds of a feather on Central, maybe helping out with one of the keynotes, and most importantly, hanging around with other developers. 

Anyways, if you are going to be in the southern hemisphere in a couple of weeks, you can&#8217;t afford to miss the conference.

The conference is February 24 and 25 in Sydney, Australia. You can find more information [here][1].
