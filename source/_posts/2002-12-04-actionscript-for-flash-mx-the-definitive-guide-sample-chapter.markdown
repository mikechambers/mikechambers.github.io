We have [posted][1] a chapter from Colin Moock&#8217;s much anticipated *ActionScript for Flash MX : The Definitive Guide*.  
You can view the chapter [here][1].  
You can buy the book [here][2].  
I posted this in my previous [message][3] on new Flash MX content at the Designer and Developer center, but I wanted to put it in its own post to make sure that it has higher visibility.
