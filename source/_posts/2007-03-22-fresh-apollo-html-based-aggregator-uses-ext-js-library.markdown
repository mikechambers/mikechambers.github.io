One of the sample apps that we have made available from the [Apollo labs site][1], is an RSS aggregator built entirely in HTML / JavaScript and CSS named [Fresh][2]. This is a pretty cool application, and really demonstrates how you can use HTML in Apollo to build desktop applications.

We have been showing this a lot over the past couple of days (at [Apollo Camp][3] and [webDU][4]), and have been incorrectly saying that the Yahoo UI library was used to create the app. This is incorrect, and was a mistake on the speakers (mostly my) part. It actually is built using the [Ext JS JavaScript Library and Components toolkit][5].

What is Ext JS? From their [website][5]:

> Ext began life as an extension to the Yahoo! User Interface Javascript library. However, it quickly exploded into a full-fledged framework of its own, and was soon launched as a separate, independent library. Ext is one of the most powerful, most expressive and easiest-to-use Javascript frameworks available today.

Basically, if you want to build Apollo applications using HTML / JavaScript, then this is the library you should start with. Not only does it provide lower level JavaScript functionality, it also provides a complete UI component toolkit, and effect library.

You can find more information on Ext JS [here][5].

If you end up making an Apollo application that uses it, make sure to post in the comments.
