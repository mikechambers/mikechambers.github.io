We are looking for examples of Flash movies that perform measurably worse on OS X than on Windows. If you have an example, please send it to <wish-flash@macromedia.com> with the following information:

*   Simple fla demonstrating the issue.
*   Steps to reproduce the issue.
*   How performance is being measured.
*   System specs on mac machine, as well as windows machine (if it was tested on both).

The more that you can isolate where the performance is being degregated, the more likely we will be able to isolate and address it.
