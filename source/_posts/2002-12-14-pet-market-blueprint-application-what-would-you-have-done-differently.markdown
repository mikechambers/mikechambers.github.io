I have started to really dig through the [Pet Market Blueprint application][1] and take the code apart. It really is a great resource on how to build complex client / server applications using Flash.  
The article provides a very good overview of how the application was put together:  
[A Tour of the PetMarket Application][2]  
However, the app is not necessarily meant as a showcase of Flash best practices. So, if you have looked through some of the code, **what do you think could be improved and / or optimized?** Post you thoughts in the comments section.
