Just a quick fyi, but the Flex team has just made [downloading the Flex SDK][1] much easier. You can now go directly to the download with the following URL:

<http://www.adobe.com/go/flexsdk2_download>

Before this change, you had to login to Adobe.com (and create an account if you didn&#8217;t have one), and then search the download page for the SDK. This link will take you directly to the download page.

Thanks to the Flex team for making it so much easier to download Flex.
