I will be speaking at the [Pocket PC Summit][1] on Wednesday about the [Macromedia Flash Player for the Pocket PC][2].  
I will probably show a lot of content and applications, as well as dive into Flash to show how simple it can be to use.  
Lots of Flash at the conference, as [Phillip Torrone][3] is also giving a [keynote][4].  
If you are attending, and want to see anything specific, post it in the comments.
