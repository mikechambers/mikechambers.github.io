We have posted a [new tech note][1] which describes how to pass login credentials from Flash to ColdFusion via Flash Remoting. Here is the description from the technote:

*This TechNote describes how to use Flash Remoting with ColdFusion&#8217;s built-in authentication mechanism and ColdFusion components. It shows how to use the ActionScript setCredentials method on the Flash side to pass credential information to the cflogin tag on the ColdFusion side.*

You can read the entire technote [here][1].
