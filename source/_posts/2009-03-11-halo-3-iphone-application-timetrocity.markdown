Not Flash related, but I wanted to make a quick post and point out a new Halo 3 related iPhone application I have created. It is called [Timetrocity][1] and is basically a weapon and item respawn timer for Halo 3.

You can find more information about it [here][1].

And yes, I am looking to create a Flash based version for other devices. More info on that in the future.
