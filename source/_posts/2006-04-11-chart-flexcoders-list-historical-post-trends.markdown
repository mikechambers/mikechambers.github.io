I have noticed over the past couple of weeks that the volume of posts to the [FlexCoder&#8217;s list][1] seemed to be increasing. So, in order to confirm this, I put together [a quick chart that plots the last two years of post volume to FlexCoders broken down by month][2].

As you can [see][2], it has definitely been trending up, with a pretty sharp rise since the beginning of the year.
