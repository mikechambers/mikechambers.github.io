I am going to hold a chat this week and make myself available to address any questions from the Flash community. If people are interested then perhaps I will make this a weekly occurrence, and occasionally have members of the Flash team attend.  
This week&#8217;s chat will be on Thursday ,October 10 at 1 PM EST, and will be held using the FCF Chat that Greg Burch on I have been working on.  
The chat can be found [here][1].
