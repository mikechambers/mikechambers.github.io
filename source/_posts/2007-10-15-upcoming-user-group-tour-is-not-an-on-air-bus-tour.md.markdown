Just a quick note, but I have been hearing that there is some confusion over the [European User Group tour][1] that Lee Brimelow and I are doing in early November. This is a user group tour, and is not a European version of the [on AIR tour][2].  
<!--more-->

  
That doesn&#8217;t mean we are not doing a full on AIR tour in Europe, but we havent announced anything yet (although you can imagine the European User Group tour would be a good opportunity to make such an announcment).

Sorry about any confusion.
