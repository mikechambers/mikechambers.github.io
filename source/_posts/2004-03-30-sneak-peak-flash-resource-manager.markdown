I have been working on a new app in my free time over the past couple of weeks, and am getting close to finishing up the first version. I thought that I would post some screenshots, and give a sneak preview of it.

The application is basically a standalone Flash Help panel and resource finder. Here are some beta screenshots:

Reference Panel showing help, multiple tabs and livedoc context menu.

Search panel, showing search results and regular expression support.

![][3]  
Plugins search panel (you can add your own plugins) and preferences panel (showing theme tab).

Btw, if you can think of a good / cool name, post it in the comments.

More info soon...
