I have held a bunch of these types of contests in the past, and this was was the toughest of all of them to judge. We were really impressed with the creativity of the applications, and especially blown away by how useful they actually are.

Thanks all of the developers / designers. If you submitted an entry, please send me an email with you contact info (<mesh@macromedia.com>). In addition to the prizes the winner&#8217;s receive, all participants will get a Flash t-shirt sent to them (let me know your size).
