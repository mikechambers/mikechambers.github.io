The guys (and gals?) over at [CentralMX.com][1] have published a new [video tutorial][2]. This one shows how to set up the Central development environment for Dreamweaver.

This is their second video tutorial, and is a great resource for quickly getting up to speed on the subjects.

You can view the tutorial [here][2].
