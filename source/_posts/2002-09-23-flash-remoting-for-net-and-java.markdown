We have released the .NET and Java versions of Flash Remoting. You can read the announcement [here][1].  
The Java version works with virtually any Java application server, and the .NET version works of course, with Microsoft .NET servers.  
You can download a trial [here][2].  
You can find more information on Flash Remoting [here][3].  
And just to head of any questions, we have not made any announcements about a version of Flash Remoting for PHP.
