Sorry I haven&#8217;t posted in a couple of days. I have been pretty swamped working on a couple of items at work.

There has been a lot of stuff going on over the past couple of days, so I am going to try to catch up in one big post.

Derek Stottlemyer has posted a beta version of his [TabSMART][1] Central application which helps teach how to play the guitar.

Ted Patrick has released a beta version of some really cool apps that allow you to make and share icons for Flash applications. You can find more information on Icon Pro and Icon Explorer [here][2].

Ted also posted his thoughts on Central development. 

*I guess until you write an application, it is hard to see value in Central. I struggled with this on the Central Beta but I now think I get it. Central is about deployment, Central is a platform.*

You can read the entire post [here][3].

Vera Fleischer updated her excellent Central [sample app and code][4] to include support for notices and Blast.

Daemonite has posted a couple of tips on developing for Central, including this tip on Central [DataGrid enhancements][5] and this tip on [using Screens in Central applications][6].

Wow. Lots of stuff going on.
