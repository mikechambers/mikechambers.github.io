I just posted this on the [on AIR tour blog][1], and wanted to make a quick note here, but the [360 Flex conference is heading to Milan, Italy][2]. I actually attended the first 360 Flex conference, and it is definitely worth it if you are at all interested in Flex development.

I won&#8217;t be able to make the event in Milan this year, but the speaker list is pretty amazing. [Check out the website][2] for a complete list, as well as session and [registration][2] information.
