Have you worked with the Flash MX (NOT Flash MX 2004) version on the Linux operating system using [CodeWeaver&#8217;s CrossOver Office][1]?Â  If so, what worked well?Â  What didn&#8217;t work?Â  How was the general performance and experience? Â Did you experience any major bugs or issues?Â  Would you recommend it to a friend?Â  Post your input in the comments.
