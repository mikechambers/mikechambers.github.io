The [Macromedia Max conference][1] starts in a little over a week. We are planning a ton of stuff around Central, so I decided to do a week of &#8220;Countdown to Max posts&#8221;. Everyday, I will post information about something related to Central at the Max conference.

The first item is of course all of the Central Related sessions:

*   [Macromedia Central: A New Frontier for Internet Applications][2] (Lea Hickman)
*   [Multi-User and Messaging Applications in Central][3] (Mike Chambers and a special guest)
*   [Creating your First Macromedia Central Application][4] (Phillip Kerman)
*   [Deconstructing a Macromedia Central Application][5] (Danny Dura)
*   [Central Application Architecture][6] (Mike Williams and Ethan Malasky)
*   [Best Practices for Central App Interface Design][7] (Kevin Lynch / Josh Ulm)

Of course, there are a ton of other sessions on Flash, Client / server development and [Halo][7] that also apply to creating Central applications. You can see a complete list of sessions, broken down by track, [here][8].

So, are you going to be at Central? If so, post in the comments. I will be there from Monday to Friday.
