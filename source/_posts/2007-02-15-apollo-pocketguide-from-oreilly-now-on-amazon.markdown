I just noticed that the book I have been working on along with Jeff Swartz and Rob Dixon just went up for pre-order on Amazon. The book title is:

[Apollo for Adobe Flex Developers Pocket Guide: A Developer&#8217;s Reference for Apollo&#8217;s Alpha Release][1]

The book covers the upcoming public alpha release (on labs) of [Apollo][2], and is targeted at developers interested in developing Apollo applications using Flex. It basically focuses on getting readers over the hump of starting with Apollo development.  
<!--more-->

  
The book will also be available for download for free once Apollo is on labs, but if you like me and prefer to read this type of stuff in print, the you can pre-order the book today.

Here is the Table of Contents:

1.  Preface
2.  Introduction to Apollo
3.  Getting Started with Apollo Development
4.  Using the File I/O API
5.  Using HTML within Flex based Apollo Applications
6.  Apollo Mini Cookbook
7.  Appendix A : Apollo Packages and Classes
8.  Appendix B : Apollo Command Line Tools

Ill post some more information on this shortly (we are doing some cool stuff with it), including the cover once it is finalized.

Also, if you are an HTML / JavaScript developer, don&#8217;t feel left out. We should have some announcements geared toward you in the next month or two.
