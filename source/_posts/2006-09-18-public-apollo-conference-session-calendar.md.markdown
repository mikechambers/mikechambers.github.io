As you may have noticed, there are quite a few conferences coming up this fall with sessions on Apollo. To help create track of these and other Apollo sessions, I have create a public [Google Calendar][1] which I will update to include all public sessions, user group meetings, etc on Apollo.

Here are the links:

*   [  
    HTML Version][2]
*   [XML Feed][3]
*   [iCal Feed][4]

If you know of any sessions / conferences that I missed, or if you are planning a user group or other meeting about Apollo, make sure to send me an email (mesh@adobe.com) so I can add it to the calendar.

You can find more info on Apollo at:
