Robin Debreuil has released [Rich Media Builder][1]. What is Rich Media Builder you ask?

*Rich Media Builder is a free, swf focused, plugin based tool that makes building rich media projects easier. The main program simply controls the running and logging of plugins. In the download, there is a single plugin that allows compiling and running a Flash file from within a text editor. It allows compiling a Flash project without leaving your favorite IDE, termination via a hotkey, clickable errors that navigate to the correct file/line, and automated builds with logging.*

The source code for the entire app is also available, which makes it a great learning tool is you are interested in c#/.net or controlling the Flash IDE programatically.

You can find more information [here][1].
