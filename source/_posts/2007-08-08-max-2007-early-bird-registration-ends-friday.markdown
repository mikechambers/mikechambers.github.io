Just a quick fyi, but the [MAX 2007 early bird registration][1] ends on Friday. If you have been thinking about attending, now is the time to do so, in order to get the best rate.

I havent had a chance to blog to much (i.e. any) about MAX this year (because of the [bus tour][2]), but I think this is going to (hands down) the best MAX ever. [Ted Patrick][3] has been put in charge of the conference, and I have been really impressed with the change in focus on the conference.
