Google just launched a new [finance portal][1], and they are using the [Flash / JavaScript integration kit][2] to integrate some Flash charting and Ajax integration.

This is similar to MeasureMap&#8217;s use of the kit ([MeasureMap ][3]was recently acquired by Google). It is a really nice combination of Flash and Ajax, and demonstrates how each can be use in a way that takes advantage of their individual strengths.

You can check out the implementation [here][1].

You can find more info on the Flash / JavaScript integration kit [here][2].
