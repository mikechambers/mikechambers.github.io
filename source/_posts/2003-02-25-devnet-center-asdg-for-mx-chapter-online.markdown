We have posted a new chapter from Colin Moock&#8217;s [ActionScript for Flash MX : The Definitive Guide][1] book on the DevNet Center.

Chapter 12, Objects and Classes is online. What does it cover?

*Chapter 12, &#8220;Objects and Classes,&#8221; introduces the concept of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Using all of the ActionScript learned in previous chapters, readers will learn what objects and classes are, terminology related to OOP, how to build custom objects, and finally how to create chains of inheritance between objects.*

You can view the chapter [here][2].
