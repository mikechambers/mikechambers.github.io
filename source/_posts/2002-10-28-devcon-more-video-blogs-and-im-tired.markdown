Well, I have been running around all day and haven&#8217;t had a chance to sit through any sessions. I have posted a couple of video weblogs.  
You can view a list of video blogs [here][1].  
Waldo Smeets actually put together a Flash app that uses a [web service][2] ([RSS feed][3], courtesy [Tim Appnel][4]) created by Jeremy Allaire to list all of the video blogs. You can view it [here][5].  
So whats up for tomorrow, DevCon Day 2? I will be doing two sessions, an advanced one of Flash Remoting, and an introduction to security in the Flash player. I also plan to finally check out some sessions.
