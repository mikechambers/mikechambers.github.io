The [Flash Updater (Ellipsis)][1] includes a [new File API for JSFL][2] which I used to put together a [couple of commands][3] that make it easy to clear your ASO cache. This comes in handy if your class files and ASO files ever get out of sync.

There are two commands included:

*   Clear ASO Cache &#8211; Clears ASO Cache
*   Clear ASO Cache and Compile &#8211; Clears ASO Cache and Test Movie

The commands require [Flash 7.2][1].

You can download them from [here][3].
