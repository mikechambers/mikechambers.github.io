Jesse Warden has a great [post][1] on his thoughts about Central. One of the things he brings up is that he has had trouble explaining the benefits of Central, but once he built an app or two, he just got it.

I have heard this quite a few times (and experienced it myself when I started with Central). Of course, as more [features][2] are added to Central, this should be less of a problem. So, i am curious, if you are doing stuff with Central now, what helped you &#8220;get it&#8221; (i.e. understand it)? If you are not doing Central development right now, what would make you want to?
