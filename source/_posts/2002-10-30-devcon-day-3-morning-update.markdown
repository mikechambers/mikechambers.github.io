Day 3 at DevCon has begun, and it looks like i will finally be able to check out some sessions. Thus far though, I have had a blast just meeting with everyone and talking to them about what they are excited about. Two themes that I have picked up on:  
People are really excited about the Flash Communication Server. That in itself is not surprising, but was has surprised me is the number of ColdFusion developers i have spoken with who are really excited about it. I think the ease of authoring using the components has really impressed developers, and made a light go off in their head where they realize that they could create these types of apps.  
The second thing is how excited people are about Flash Remoting. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love Flash Remoting, and I am very excited about it. But I have had a ton of people tell me how much easier it has made things for them. I was speaking with a couple of ColdFusion developers this morning, and they said that if it wasn&#8217;t for Flash Remoting, they wouldn&#8217;t even bother with Flash.  
So, whats on the agenda for today? I have a session in a little while on the Flash Player Security model, and then I will finally have some time to go to some sessions (I will be going to Sam Wan&#8217;s session on data visualization). Sometime today, I am going to strap my webcam to my shoulder and broadcast live from DevCon. Ill just walk around and talk to people. It will probably be around lunch, and I will post some info here when I start.  
BTW, we have a section of the Designer and Developer Center devoted to daily DevCon coverage. You can view it [here][1].  
Finally, don&#8217;t forget to check out the [DevCon section][2] of my site. All of my DevCon posts go there (they don&#8217;t all make it to the main page).
