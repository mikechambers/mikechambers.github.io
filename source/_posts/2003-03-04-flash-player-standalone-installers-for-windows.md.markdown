I have seen a lot of emails come in today asking how users can deploy the new Flash player on multiple machines. For these scenarios, we have a standalone installer for Windows (msi and exe installers), that makes it much easier to upgrade multiple machines.

You can find more information on how to get access to the standalone installers on the [Flash Player Distribution Program page][1].
