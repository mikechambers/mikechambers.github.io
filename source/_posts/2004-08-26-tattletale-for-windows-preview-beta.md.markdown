[Yesterday][1] I released a preview version of the MAC OS X version of TattleTale. Today I am releasing a (slightly rougher) beta version of TattleTale for Windows.

What is TattleTale? TattleTale is a simple application that makes it easy to keep up with the latest news and information from Macromedia. Here is a screenshot of the Windows version:

Note, the icons for the Windows version of TattleTale are place holders and not final.

Note : Requires the .NET runtime (all 23 megs of it), which can be download from [here][2].
