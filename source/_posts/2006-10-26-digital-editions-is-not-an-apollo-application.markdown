We launched a new project on labs the other day called [Digital Editions][1]. What is Digital Editions? From the site:

> Adobe Digital Editions is a completely new way to read and manage eBooks and other digital publications. Digital Editions is built from the ground up as a lightweight, rich Internet application (RIA). Digital Editions works online and offline, and supports both PDF and XHTML-based content.

Basically, this is (currently) a Windows only executable that integrates Flash and PDF to create a rich application for reading eBooks. Really cool stuff.

There seems to be a lot of questions and confusion over whether this is an Apollo application. It is NOT an Apollo application (The fact that it is currently Windows only should be a tip off). This is covered in the [FAQ][2], but I wanted to make a post to help clear up some of the confusion.
