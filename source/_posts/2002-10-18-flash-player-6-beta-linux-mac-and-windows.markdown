We have a new [beta][1] of the Flash Player 6 today, with versions available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.  
This is a very big release, with quite a few bug fixes, new features (wider WMODE support,&nbsp;custom request headers, etc...) and performance optimizations.  
We are really trying to create as high a quality player as possible, and thus we need your helping in reporting&nbsp;any issues / problems that you run into (we are giving prizes away to the top bug submitters).  
Here are the links:  
  
*   [Main Beta Page][1]  
    *   [FAQ][2]  
        *   [Release Notes][3]  
            *   [Downloads][4]  
                *   [Report Bugs][5]</UL>
                  
                Remember though, that this is a Beta and should not be used in product environments.  
                Post your favorite feature, bug fix in the comments. I will also be hanging around in the [chat][6] answering any questions that come up.</p>
