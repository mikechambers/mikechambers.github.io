We have announced a new product today, named [Contribute][1]. What is Contribute?  
*Contribute is the easiest way to update content for any HTML website, including sites built in Macromedia Dreamweaver, Microsoft FrontPage, and other web tools. With Contribute, non-technical users can make changes while automatically respecting site standards for style, layout, and code in minutesÂ—without knowing HTML.*  
Basically, it makes making small changes to a web page super simple. I have been using it a while for my internal pages at Macromedia, and it saves me a ton of time.  
You can find more information at the Contribute [product page][1], or read one of the many articles on Contribute at the new [Contribute Development Center][2].&nbsp; (There are already tons of article and tutorials available).  
You can also download a working technology preview version of Contribute [here][3].  
You should also check out this week&#8217;s [logged in][4], and [JD&#8217;s Forum][5], both which discuss Contribute and its implications.  
If you were at DevCon then there is a good chance you have already seen a sneak peak of this (remember the </ hassle> sessions?).
