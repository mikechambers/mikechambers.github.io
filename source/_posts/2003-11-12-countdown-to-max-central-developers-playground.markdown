One of the things that I am setting up for [Macromedia MAX Conference][1] next week is something that we are calling the &#8220;Central Developer&#8217;s Playground&#8221;. This is a chance for developers to get together, hang around, play video games (XBOX and PS2), listen to music, eat pizza, drink beer / coke, work on Central applications, ask questions and meet the Central team.

It will be pretty informal, so even if you are not planning on doing Central development anytime soon, you should still stop by to hang around and chat.

The get together is Wednesday night, from 7:30 pm to 1am. More details at the conference.
