I just did a minor update to the [Macromedia News Firefox Extension][1]. The new version is 0.9.7 and adds support for Firefox 1.0.7.

What is the Macromedia News Firefox Extension? From the [extension page][1]:

> The Macromedia News Extension for the Firefox browser and Thunderbird client provides a simple way to keep up with the latest news, information and weblog posts from Macromedia. It places a small icon on your Firefox or Thunderbird status bar. The icon will blink when there is new information, and when clicked, displays the latest information from Macromedia, allowing you to click on any item for more information.

You can find more information about the extension, as well as download it from [here][1].
