[JD][1] pointed out a couple of new items on [Macromedia.com][2].  
The first is a new movie on our [main page][2] touting the advantages to upgrading to MX. Really nice integrating of video into a Flash movie. You can view it [here][2].  
He also points out that we have released a [Rich Internet Application Starter Kit][3]. To be honest, I didn&#8217;t know about this, but it looks like it could be pretty useful. From the webpage:  
*After reviewing this kit, youÂ’ll have the necessary context to get started with your first Rich Internet Application. This includes setting the project schedule, defining skill and tool requirements for the development team, drafting the technical architecture, and integrating the application into your existing environment.*  
You can find more info [here][3].
