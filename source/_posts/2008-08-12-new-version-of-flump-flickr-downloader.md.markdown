I have posted a new build of [Flump][1], which is an Adobe AIR based Flickr image downloader. There are AIR files for [AIR 1.1][2] (Mac and Windows) and the [Adobe AIR Linux Alpha][3].  
<!--more-->

  
Biggest change in this version is that the app now supports Flickr account authorization, and also enforces image license restrictions when not authenticated.

There are probably a few bugs in this release, so just post them here or on the [Flump issue page][4].

You can find more information as well as download it from [here][1].
