I gave a sneak peak of [DevNet Resource Kit Volume 3][1], which we are just wrapping up. It is really shaping up to be the strongest DRK yet, with:

*   Full ColdFusion Content
*   8 New Components including a new Flash UI Component Set
*   ActionScript DataValidation Library
*   A number of sample application with full source code.
*   Dreamweaver content and extensions.

I showed one of the sample applications included on DRK 3, RSSify. This application creates, edits and managers RSS / XML Feeds, and Macromedia actually uses it internally to publish our new DevNet RSS XML feed.

The app is pretty sweet, and I used it to show some of the new components that will be on DRK 3 including a Tab component, TextField (my favorite), and Accordion Pane.

I also showed a Flash based RSS News Aggregation application that is also included on DRK 3.

[DevNet Resource Kit Volume 3][1] will be available to DevNet Pro and DevNet Essentials subscribers in a couple of weeks.
