I have created a simple shell that allows the Central Debug panel to run outside of the Flash IDE. Among other things, it allows you to set the panel to always be on top, which makes it easy to watch trace information from Central.

Requirements:

*   Windows
*   .NET Framework
*   Flash Player 6 or higher ActiveX control

You can download the installer from [here][1].

Note, this is something that I did in my own time, and is not supported by Macromedia. Use at your own risk.

FYI, I plan to make a Mac OSX version in the next couple of weeks.

If you have any comments, suggestions or problems, post them in the comments.
