[Dave Yang][1] has put up a ServerSide ActionScript / Flash Remoting example that lists all of the functions and properties of the ServerSide ActionScript CF object. This is similar to the [example][2] i posted the other day, except Dave&#8217;s example provides more information and is a little more elegant&nbsp;(I like how Dave organizes his NetServices code).  
You can view the example [here][3].
