As you can see, my weblog has a new server, url, and most noticeably, a new look. Thanks to [Josh Dura][1] who put together this kick ass design for my site. 

When linking to the main page of this site, please use this URL:

<http://www.macromedia.com/go/blog_mchambers>

The domain name will probably change soon, and that URL will always redirect to the current site.  
<!--more-->

  
So why a new server and blogging tool? The main reason I moved is that by using [MovableType][2] on my own server, I have complete control over virtually everything. For example, I am deploying the pages as [ColdFusion][3] templates, which will allow us to do some pretty cool stuff. I will also be able to install [Flash Communication Server][4] and use [Flash Remoting][5].

Expect to see some pretty cool stuff in the coming weeks. Not just on this weblog, but from Macromedia weblogs in general.

I am still working out a few kinks, so if you run into any problems or broken links, post them in the comments.
