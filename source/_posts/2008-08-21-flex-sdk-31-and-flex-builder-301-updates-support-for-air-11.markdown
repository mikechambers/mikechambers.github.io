Im a little late on this, but the Flex and Flex Builder teams [just released updates to the Flex SDK and Flex Builder 3][1], which among other things, adds support for Adobe AIR 1.1.

There are also a ton of [bug fixes for the Flex SDK][2] and [Flex Builder,][3] as well as preliminary support for working with [Flash Player 10][4] content in Flex Builder (although it is not clear where to download the debug player from. Im looking into this).

You can [download the Flex 3.1 update from the Flex downloads page][5] (it is build 3.1.0.2710 from Fri Aug 15 2008).

You can find information on how to update Flex Builder in this [article][1] (Im trying to find out if we have a downloadable installer).

Update (August 28, 2008) : The Flex Builder 3.0.1 update is now on the [Flex Builder Updates][6] page for download.
