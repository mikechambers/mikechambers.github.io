If you were lucky enough to have been at [FlashForward San Francisco][1], you would have seen a quick sneak peak of a new technology we are working on code-named&#8221;Royale&#8221; (I posted about it [here][2]). Since then, there has been a lot of questions about Royale from developers.

Well, we have just released some more information on our [website][3] about Royale. The site contains an [FAQ][4], and also allows you to sign up to be notified when we release more information.

You can view the site [here][3].
