I was looking through my referrer logs and notice that Robert Hall has started a Flash [weblog][1]. Robert has done some really cool stuff with Flash on devices (Flash bank on Pocket PC, Flash on ATMs), and some text -> speech -> Flash, so it should be interesting to see what he puts up there.  
Robert also wrote a chapter about Flash on standalone kiosks and ATMs in [Flash Enabled][2].
