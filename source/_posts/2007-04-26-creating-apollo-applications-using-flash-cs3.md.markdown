Now that [Flash CS3 is available][1], a lot of people have been asking when they will be able to author [Apollo][2] applications with it. We are working closely with the Flash Authoring team on a set of extensions that will make it easy to author Apollo applications directly within Flash CS3.

However, you can author Apollo content from within CS3, but it does require a bit of hackery. Fortunately, Guy Watson has released an [extension for Flash CS3 that makes it much easier to test Apollo content directly from Flash CS3][3]. So, if you are loving Flash CS3, and are interested in Apollo, then [check out Guy&#8217;s extension][3].

Ill post more info on the time line for the Apollo extensions from Adobe as the information becomes available.
