The answers panel within Flash MX (and all other MX products with an answers panel)&nbsp;has been updated. It will automatically update within the next week, but if you want to force the update:  
  
1.  Open the panel (Window > Answer Panel).
  
2.  Select &#8220;settings&#8221;.
  
3.  Press the &#8220;Update Now&#8221; button.

  
There is some new stuff in the panel including the latest resources from the [Des / Dev][1] center, as well as the current Macromedia [Site of the Day][2].  
You can find more info about the answers panel [here][3].
