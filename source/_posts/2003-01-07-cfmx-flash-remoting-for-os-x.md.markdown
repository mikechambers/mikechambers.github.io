We [announced][1] today that the developer version of CFMX J2EE Developer edition is now available for Mac OS X. What does this mean? It means that you can install JRun 4 on OS X and run CFMX on top of that, and do all of your ColdFusion and Flash Remoting development on OS X.  
Christian Cantrell wrote a logged in [article][2] with some info on the announcement and has posted some info and links on here [weblog][3].  
You can find more information, as well as download all of the bits you need [here][4].
