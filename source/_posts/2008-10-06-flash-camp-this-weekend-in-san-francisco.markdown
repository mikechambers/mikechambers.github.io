If you are in the San Francisco Bay area (or not too far away), then make sure to check out [Flash Camp][1] this weekend, being held in the Adobe San Francisco office by the Flash team.

This is an all weekend event that will go in depth over the new Flash Player 10 and Flash Authoring features. Its a great chance to get up to speed really quickly on all of the new APIs and features, as well as hang out and have a few beers with the Flash team.

Plus, everyone attending will get a Free copy of Flash CS4 Professional!

You can find more information on the [Flash Camp blog][1].
