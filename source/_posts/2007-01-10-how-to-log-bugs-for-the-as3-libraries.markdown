Just a quick fyi, but now that [we have moved the ActionScript 3 Open source libraries over to Google Code][1], we finally have a bug base so anyone can submit issues.

So, if you run into a bug with any of the libraries, or have a feature request, please take a minute or two to log a bug and let us know about it.

Also, if you run into an issue, make sure to check the bug bases to see if someone else has reported on it, and whether it has been fixed in source, or there is a workaround.

For example, he is a link to the [bug base for the corelib project][2].

You can find a list of all of the projects [here][1].
