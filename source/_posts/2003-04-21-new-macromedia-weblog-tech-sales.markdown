We have launched a new Macromedia weblog. The Macromedia [Tech Sales weblog][1] is run by some of our Sales Engineers (SEs). They are the developers who go out and run the seminars about our products, and use the tools almost every days.

There are already two posts (or I should say mini tutorials) up on the site:

[Facade Pattern in ActionScript][2]

[Sending XML from Flash to ColdFusion][3]

They will be making posts about multiple products and technologies, so make sure to check them out.

You can view the site at:
