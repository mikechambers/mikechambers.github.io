[PNut][1] posted that [JAWS][2]&nbsp;4.5, one of the most popular screen readers, has added [support][3] for Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA), which in turn means it now has support for Flash Player 6 content.  
[Window-Eyes][4] the other major Windows screen reader also has support for Flash Player 6 content.  
You can find more information on Macromedia Flash MX and accessibility at the:
