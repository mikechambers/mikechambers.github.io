Congratulations to Deng Jie from China. He was the first to [find cartoon Mike][1] and win a copy of [DRK][2] Volume 2.  
I&#8217;ll have some more contests like this in the future, maybe one where you have to find cartoon mike across a number of Flash weblogs.  
If you have any ideas for contests, post them in the comments section.
