Thanks to everyone who offered their services as a designer in response to my [request][1]. The position has been filled and you should see the results of the work in the coming days (it is pretty sweet).

Also, there will be some changes with my weblog in the coming weeks, possibly including a new URL. If you link to my weblog, please use this URL:

<http://www.macromedia.com/go/blog_mchambers>

as that will always point to my weblog, even it it moves.

Sorry for the sporadic posts lately, but as I mentioned above, I have been working on some changes to the weblog, and will hopefully get back up to speed soon.
