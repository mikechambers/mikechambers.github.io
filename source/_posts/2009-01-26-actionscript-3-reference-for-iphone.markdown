The iTunes app store has just approved my first application, and has posted it online. The application is an [ActionScript 3 class reference for the iPhone](http://www.mikechambers.com/as3iphone/) and allows quick and easy access to the ActionScript 3 class reference docs for Flash Player 10, AIR 1.5, and Flex 3.2.

You can find more information on the application, view screenshots and log feature requests on the [application's home page](http://www.mikechambers.com/as3iphone/). You can install the application directly from the iTunes app store from [here](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=302952929&#038;mt=8).

Special thanks to [De Monsters](http://www.demonsters.com/) who put together the graphics and icons for the app.
