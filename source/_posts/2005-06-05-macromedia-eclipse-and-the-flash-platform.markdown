I will post more on this in the morning, but I wanted to get a quick post up before I go to bed. 

First, we just [announced][1] that we have joined the [Eclipse foundation][2] and are working on an Eclipse based IDE for creating rich internet applications (code-named Zorn).

Second, we have launched a new section of our website focused on the [Flash Platform][3]. Tons of info here. For starters, make sure to check out the [Flash Platform white paper][4] written by Kevin Lynch.

You can visit the Flash Platform center [here][3].
