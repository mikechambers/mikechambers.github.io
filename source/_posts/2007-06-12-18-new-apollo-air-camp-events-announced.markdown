As you may have [read][1], we just announced that we are doing [an 18 city bus tour through North America this summer][2], where we will be holding [Apollo / AIR Camp events][2]. We have launched a [website][2], where you can find more information about the tour, [including cities, dates, agenda][3] and news.

I just checked the latest registration numbers, and the space is filling up pretty quick. So, head on over to the site, find the [city][3] closest to you, and make sure to register.

You can find more information on the [website][2], on the [bus tour blog][4], and in this [video overview of the tour][5].
