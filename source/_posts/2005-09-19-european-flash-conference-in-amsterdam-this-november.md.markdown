I am so excited that this is finally happening. United Digital Artists, one of the two companies that have put on all of the past FlashForward conferences is launching a [new Flash conference in Europe][1]. I have been working with UDA behind the scenes to help make this happen, and it is shaping up to be a killer conference.

First, here are the details.

November 16 &#8211; 18 in Amsterdam (at the really cool [Paradiso][2])

There is a partial list of confirmed speakers on the conference website, and looking at the list, it is clear that this is truly a European conference:

MATHIEU ANTHOINE/Yamago (France)  
ARAL BALKAN/Ariaware (UK)  
MIKE CHAMBERS/ Macromedia (US)  
HOSS GIFFORD, FlamJam (UK)  
CHAFIC KAZOUN/B-Line Express (US)  
JOOST KORNGOLD, Renascent (Netherlands)  
KEVIN LYNCH/Macromedia (US);  
GRANT SKINNER/ gskinner.com (Canada)  
CRAIG SWANN/ CRASH!Media (Spain)  
OWEN VAN DIJK/Mutoid (Netherlands)  
GUY WATSON/Flashguru (UK).  
SASCHA WOLTER/Flashforum (GERMANY)  
DANNY DURA, Macromedia (US)

The timing for the conference could not be better, since it is just after the Flash 8 launch, and right after MAX (which means there will be some very cool stuff to show / talk about).

Anyways, I&#8217;ll be there, and I think this is a must attend conference if you are in Europe. I know the UDA people want to make this a regular conference, so hopefully this is the start of a regular event in Europe.

I expect that this will sell out quickly, so make sure to register as soon as possible.
