I just noticed that we have a [Adobe CS3 Video Workshop][1] was contains a TON of videos and video tutorials for all of the CS3 products. There are 34 videos for just Flash CS3 alone!

Anyways, if you are interested in learning more about some of the CS3 products then make sure to check out the [video workshop][1].
