Branden Hall, of [FlashCoders][1] / everything Flash ActionScript fame, &nbsp;has set up a weblog over at [waxpraxis.org][2], and has already made quite a few posts on his first day.  
Among other things, he mentions that he has a book coming out soon ([FlashEnabled][3]) on creating Flash content for devices (note : i also worked on this book).  
I am really excited about the number of quality Flash related weblogs ([1][4], [2][2], [3][5], [4][6], [5][7], [6][8]) that have sprung up.&nbsp;They provide a way of quickly getting Flash information and news, without having to search through and clog up the mailing lists and forums. They have completely changed the way I participate in the Flash community (for the better). Thoughts?
