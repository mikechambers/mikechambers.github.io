I lucked out on my flight to Europe and got booked on Lufthansa. This is really cool because they have high speed internet access on their flight between San Francisco and Frankfurt. In fact, I am posting this from seat 24C somewhere over Greenland.

Anyways, just a reminder that I am doing a mini speaking tour in Europe this week, and will be speaking at Flash Festival in Paris this weekend. If you are in Vaasa, London or Paris, make sure to come out to the meetings.

I will be giving an update on the latest happenings in the Flash ecosystem. I&#8217;ll also go over the latest news and information on what the future holds for Flash, and maybe even give a sneak peak or two.

You can find a list of meetings [here][1].
