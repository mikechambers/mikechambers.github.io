Just a quick reminder that I am going to hold a chat today at 1 pm EST. This is your chance to hang around with other Flash developers, and ask any Flash related questions that you like.  
The chat is at 1 PM EST, and is located [here][1].  
Depending out the turnout and interest, I might make this a weekly occurrence.
