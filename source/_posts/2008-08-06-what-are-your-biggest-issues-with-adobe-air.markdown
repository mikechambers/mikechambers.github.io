What are your biggest issues, bugs and annoyances with Adobe AIR? I am specifically looking for input on both developers bugs, and end user bugs. I am not looking for input on features you would like added (Ill do that in another post).

We already have a pretty good idea of the main issues (based on the forums, bug reports, blogs, testing and twitter), but your comments here will be another useful data point.

As usual, you can always submit the issues directly to the AIR team [here][1].

So, post your biggest Adobe AIR annoyances, bugs and issues in the comments. Keep comments on topic.
