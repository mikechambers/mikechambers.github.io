PhilterBlog has posted a quite [extensive list of Flash MX component resources][1]. 

You can view the list [here][1].

I also put together a comprehensive list of component resource, which no longer as comprehensive, is still very useful.

You can view my weblog post listing component resources [here][2].

Hmm, maybe it is time to get something like this up on the DevNet center. If you know of any resources that I or Philterblog missed, please list them in the comments.
