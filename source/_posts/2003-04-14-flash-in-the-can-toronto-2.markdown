I just arrived in Toronto for the [Flash in the Can][1] conference this week. It is really shaping up to be an awesome conference, and I am looking forward to hanging out with everyone.

I will be helping out with the keynote, and then have a session on Flash Remoting.

In my session I plan to talk about using object oriented client server interfaces with Flash Remoting to create reusable client / server APIs. I plan on showing a couple of examples, and then talk about adding an event driven model to the architecture.

Anyways, I&#8217;ll be posting with update through the week.
