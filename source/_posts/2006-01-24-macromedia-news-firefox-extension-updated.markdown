I have uploaded a new version of the [Macromedia News Firefox extension][1]. This version adds support for Firefox 1.5.

Sorry it took so long.

You can find more information, as well as install the extension from [here][1].

Ill probably do another build in the coming weeks to update the name and branding.

If you run into any issues, just post them in the comments.
