You may have noticed the online poll on the right of the page. This is actually the Flash interface to the [Pollster sample application][1] included on [DRK 4][2].

Pollster includes the following:

*   A Flash Interface to place on your website.
*   Complete Admin back-end written in ColdFusion
*   A [Dreamweaver extension][3] that makes it easy to insert the poll into your web site.

The Poll has quite a few features including:

*   [Complete admin back-end][4].
*   Limit votes per user.
*   View results in HTML.
*   Export raw results to Excel.
*   Enabled and Disable Polls.
*   Supports up to 5 answers.
*   Complete source code for Flash interface is included.
*   Complete source code for ColdFusion back-end included.
*   ActionScript API and Library for creating your own Flash interfaces.

The Flash interface uses the Pie Chart component from the [Flash Charting Components Set 2][5], also included on [DRK 4][2].

Finally, there is code that protects against users abusing the poll (by mass voting). However, it is not full proof.

You can view an image of the admin interface [here][4].
