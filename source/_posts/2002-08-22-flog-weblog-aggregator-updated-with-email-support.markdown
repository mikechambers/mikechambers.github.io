[Flog][1], one of my favorite aggregators for Flash news feeds, has been updated. In addition to aggregating all of the XML news feeds from all of the Flash related weblogs, it will also list any Macromedia related new from Google.  
However, the coolest feature, is that you can sign up and have the latest news [emailed][2] to you every morning. This is a very good way to make sure that you keep on top of what is going on the the Flash world.  
You know, these weblogs might be around for a while...
