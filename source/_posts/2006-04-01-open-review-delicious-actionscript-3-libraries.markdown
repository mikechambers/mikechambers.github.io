I am working on an ActionScript 3 library for the [del.icio.us online API][1]. I have most of the stub code written, and [documented][2]. Before I really start writing the code, I wanted to get feedback on the current API, and see if any one had any comments and / or suggestions.

I have [posted the API docs online][2], and you can use those to review the API.

del.icio.us does not have a crossdomain.xml file, so I still need to figure out to best way to allow the user of the API to specify a proxy for the class to use (when necessary).

You can view the API docs [here][2].

Btw, I will be posting the final version to [labs][3] under an [open source license][4].

Anyways, post any questions or suggestions in the comments.
