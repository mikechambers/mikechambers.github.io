We have published a very good article explaining the Flash Communication Server component Framework.  
  
*   [Macromedia Flash Communication Server MX : Understanding the Component Framework][1]

  
This was written by two of the developers who put the framework together, and is an excellent resource.  
This will come in handy as we move the [FCF project][2] to work within the existing component framework.
