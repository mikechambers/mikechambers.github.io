Well, as you have probably seen from the [50 million posts on MXNA][1] about it, last night we posted the latest beta of Flex 2 / Flash Player 9 to [labs][2]. This beta drop includes the following:  
<!--more-->

*   Flash Player 9 (the Player formerly known as Flash Player 8.5)
*   Flex Builder 2.0
*   Flex SDK 2.0 (includes Flex Framework and command-line compiler for Mac, Windows, Linux, etc...)
*   Flex Charting Components
*   Flex Builder 2.0

You can find more information on everything in this release on the [labs wiki][3]. 

We have also posted a couple of resources on what is new and what has changed in beta 3:

[Beta 3 API Changes][4]  
[Article : What&#8217;s changed since Beta 2][5]

Make sure to read the [Beta 3 API changes document][4], as it will save you some time and hassle when updating existing content to beta 3. From this point forward, there should not be very many API changes, so this should be the last time you have to do any significant updating between releases.

You can grab everything you need to get started from [here][2].
