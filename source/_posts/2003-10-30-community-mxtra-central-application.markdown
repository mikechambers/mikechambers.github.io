Paul Newman from [CommunityMX][1] has put together a Central [application][2] that provides an interface to the CommunityMX site, displaying the latests articles and letting you search their entire article archive.

This application is based on an existing Flash application that Paul had already built, and he outlines some of the changes he had to make (not many) to make it run within Central.

This is only version .70 but it is already pretty polished. 

You can view install the application from CommunityMX [here][2].
