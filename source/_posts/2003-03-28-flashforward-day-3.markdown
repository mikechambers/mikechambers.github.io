It is the beginning of the third day at [FlashForward][1]. The [FilmFestival][2] last night was fun as usual. They limited the finalist to 4 this year, so it flowed much quicker.

I am giving a session on Flash Remoting this morning (discussing Object Oriented Client / Service Interfaces) and then a QA session. After that I plan to catch Phillip Torrone&#8217;s session, and then Erik Natzke&#8217;s

I&#8217;ll try and post updates through the day.
