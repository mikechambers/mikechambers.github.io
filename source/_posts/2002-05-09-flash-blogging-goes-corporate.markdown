<!--StartFragment -->Wired.com has an 

[article][1] up today discussing the Macromedia weblogs. Myself, [Branden Hall][2], and [Dave Winer][3] are all quoted, and over all i think that it covers exactly why we are doing this. It allows us to communicate faster and more efficiently with our community.  
It was [John Dowdell][4] who really drove the idea internally at Macromedia. Also, David Burrows&#8217; [FlashBlog][5] really helped me to realize how useful a tool the weblogs could be.
