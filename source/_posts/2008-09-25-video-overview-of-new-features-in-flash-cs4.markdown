[Lee Brimelow][1] has put together [a video demonstrating some of the new features of Flash CS4][2]. My favorites thus far include the new UI, inverse kinematics (really cool when applied to shapes), new animation tools and features, and Flex created SWCs working in CS4.

You can view the entire video [here][2].

You can find more information on Flash CS4 [here][3].
