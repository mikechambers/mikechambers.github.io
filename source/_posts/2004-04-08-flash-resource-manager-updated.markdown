I have just uploaded an updated to the [Flash Resource Manager][1]. This version includes a couple of fixes for users running non-English versions of Flash.

Specifically:

*   Added ability to automatically determine Flash Authoring language
*   Fixed problems with parsing non-English help XML documents

Note : You should no longer need to resave your help XML files into the correct encoding type.

If you are running an English version of Flash, there is not need to install this version.

It is recommended that you first un-install the previous version and then install the new version.

You can download the new version from [here][1].

If you run into any issues, post them in the comments [here][1].
