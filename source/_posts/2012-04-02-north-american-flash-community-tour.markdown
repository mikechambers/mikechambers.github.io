Just as we did in Europe a couple of weeks ago, [Lee Brimelow][1] and I are doing a series of Flash get togethers in North America over the next couple of weeks. I will be talking about the [roadmap for the Flash runtimes][2], and leading a discussion around recent development in the Flash world. Lee will be showing off some of the new stuff we are working on around gaming.

Here are the cities and dates:

* [Denver : April 3][3]
* [Nashville : April 9][4]
* [Atlanta : April 10][5]
* [St Paul, April 11][6]
* [New York, April 12][7]

We will also be doing meetings in San Francisco, LA, Chicago and Mexico City. Ill update this post once we finalize the details for those cities.

In addition to these events, Lee Brimelow is doing some additional events in Las Vegas and Tempe. Check out his [blog for more info][8].
