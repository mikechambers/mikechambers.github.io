We have released all of the [source FLAs][1] from the movies from our [Flash Video gallery][2]. What is the Flash Video Gallery? From the site:

*The Flash Video Gallery is an interactive showcase of Macromedia Customer videos, produced by the Marketing team at Macromedia.*

Not sure how many there are, but it looks like a lot. This is a great resource for seeing how some of these movies are put together.

You can download the source files from [here][1].
