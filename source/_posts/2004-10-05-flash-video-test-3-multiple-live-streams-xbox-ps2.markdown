I am going to be running [another][1] Flash video [test][2] over the next hour or so in the [Central DevChat][3]. I am testing how well I can stream multiple live feeds. One will be from an Xbox and or PS2, and one will from a webcam overlooking the action.

Just log into DevChat, and open multiple video Pods (View > Console > Pods > Central DevChat > Video Feeds)

Ill post more info after the test.
