Greg Burch just launched his [new weblog][1]. He has switched to [MovableType][2] and has a completely new design.

The coolest thing though is the Flash based application he has on his site which basically keeps track of what he is doing or working on, his location, and the device he is currently using. Pretty cool stuff.

You can view his site [here][3].

Make sure that you update your URLs to point to the new site and RSS feed.
