I was just reading this [article][1] about the closing of WebMonkey. One of the things they mentioned were &#8220;stunt journalism&#8221; articles where they would do things such as write chat engines, or search engines in four lines of code.

Hmm&#8230; pretty interesting. So, knowing the ingenuity of the Flash community, I thought I would see what you could do. So, lets start off with something easy, can you create a search engine in Flash in 4 lines of code or less? If so, post the code in the comments (you can use any components included with Flash MX 2004 Pro).
