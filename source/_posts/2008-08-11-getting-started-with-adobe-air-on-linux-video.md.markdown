I have just posted a video over at [gotoandlearn.com][1] that walks through how to [get AIR applications running on Linux using the Adobe AIR for Linux Alpha][1].

The video covers:  
<!--more-->

*   Installing Adobe AIR
*   Downloading and Installing AIR applications
*   Uninstalling AIR applications

Here are some of the links mentioned in the video:

*   [Adobe AIR for Linux Alpha][2]
*   [Adobe AIR for Linux Alpha Release Notes][3]
*   [TweetDeck][4]

I am planning on doing another video shortly, showing how to build, test and deploy AIR application on Linux, using both Flex, Flex Builder for Linux and HTML.
