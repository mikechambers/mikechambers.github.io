I have just uploaded the latest version of the slides for the Apollo Overview / Getting Started presentation I have been giving. Here are the links to different formats:

*   [Apple Keynote][1]
*   [Powerpoint][2]
*   [PDF][3]

Remember, Apollo is still pre-release and thus all information in the slides is subject to change. The information is accurate as of January 2007.

You can find more infomation on Apollo [here][4].

Post any questions / suggestions in the comments.
