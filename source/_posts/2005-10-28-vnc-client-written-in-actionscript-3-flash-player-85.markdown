Check this out. Darron Schall has put together a Flash Player 8.5 VNC ([Virtual Network Computing][1]) [client][2] with ActionScript 3. Basically, it is a remote desktop client that allows you to view and control other computers remotely. 

Darron has a good [post][2] up explaining what new features in Flash Player 8.5 / ActionScript 3 made this possible.

You can find more info on the VNC client over at [Darron&#8217;s weblog][2].

If you want to download and play with ActionScript 3 (via Flex Builder / mxmlc), you can grab it from [Labs][3].
