Woah! Just noticed that the [FlashForward conference has been producing a podcast][1]. It looks like they have done about 10 thus far, and most of them consist of Lynda Weinman talking with some of the top Flash developers and designers.

Interviews so far include:

*   Branden Hall
*   James Patterson
*   Robert Rheinhardt
*   Chapman Brotherrs of homestarrunner.com
*   Craig Swann

This is definitely one to keep an eye (ear?) on. 

You can find more information on the podcasts, as well as how to subscribe to them on the FlashForward [blog][1].
