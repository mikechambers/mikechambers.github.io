You may have seen this yesterday, but [Christian Cantrell][1] and I have put together the first [Macromedia Developer Relations Podcast][2]. It is 30 minutes of pure Macromedia geek, and covers the latest news and happenings around Macromedia technologies.

This podcast covers a number of topics, including an interview with [Mark Anders][3], VP of engineering, working on [Zorn][4], deep linking issues in RIAs, and the Flash / JavaScript Integration kit.

You can find a complete index of the show, as well as download the podcast from [here][2].

You can subscribe to the podcast from [here][5].

Btw, we are planning to add the podcast to [iTunes][6], but they appear to be having some technical difficulties today. As soon as things calm down we will add it, and make a post on the podcast weblog.
