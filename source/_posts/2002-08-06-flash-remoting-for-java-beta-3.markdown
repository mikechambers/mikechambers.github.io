Beta 3 of Flash Remoting for Java is now available. Aside from updated documentation, we have also changed the installation procedure allowing you to install Flash Remoting on any Java application server, such as IBM WebSphere, Tomcat, BEA Weblogic, Resin, and others.&nbsp; We have removed any server-specific requirements in an effort to provide the broadest possible Java server support.  
What does that mean? Well, among other things, you can now use Flash Remoting on OSX using Apache and Tomcat. You can get ColdFusion MX running on OSX, but it is not currently the easiest process in the world.  
You can sign up for the beta [here][1].
