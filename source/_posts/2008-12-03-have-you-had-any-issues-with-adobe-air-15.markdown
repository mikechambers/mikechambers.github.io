The title pretty much sums it up. Have you run into any new issues in [Adobe AIR 1.5][1]? Specifically, I am looking for anything that may have worked in AIR 1.1, which no longer works in AIR 1.5.

For example:  
<!--more-->

  
SHIFT + SPACE doesn&#8217;t work correctly in AIR 1.5, but worked fine in AIR 1.1. (Bug #1932338).

Just post the info in the comments (including OS info), and please leave your email address in case the team needs to get in touch with you for more information. Please keep comments on topic.
