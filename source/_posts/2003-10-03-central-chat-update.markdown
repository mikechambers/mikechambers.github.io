Well the [Central Chat][1] has been a lot more popular than I expected. Tons of people in it everyday, including a bunch of people from the Central Team. 

We have been adding new features daily? Some of the highlights include video pods (thanks [Peldi][2]), and screen resizing (thanks [Kevin][3]).

We had about 6 or 7 video feeds going today, with about 3 or 4 from the Central Team offices.

Click the installation badge on the left to install the chat, or if you have already installed it, open it and check for updates (Central Dev Chat > Check for Updates).

We are always looking for new features to add, so if you have any suggestions post them in the chat or here.
