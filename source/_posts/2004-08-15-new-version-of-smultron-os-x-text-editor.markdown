I just notice that a [new version (1.01) of Smultron][1] has been released. Smultron is an excellent open source Cocoa based text editor for OS X, that is fast, has basic support for ActionScript color coding, and has a single window document model. You can find a list of changes [here][2].

You can find more information about, as well as download Smultron from [here][1].

Btw, I have my own version running locally which adds support for compiling (Publish and Test Movie) FLAs, which I will try to release in the next couple of days.
