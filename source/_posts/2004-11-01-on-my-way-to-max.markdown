I am sitting in the LA airport waiting to get on my flight to New Orleans so I thought I would make a quick post.

I am posting this from my phone so I am going to keep it short. I am not doing any sessions this year as I really want to have a chance to hang out with everyone. However, I am in charge of the sneaks session on Wednesday. I can&#8217;t give any details, but I can say that it is going to be very &#8220;enlightening&#8221;. If you are at Max you can&#8217;t miss this session. If you are not there, then hope that someone video tapes it.

Ill post more once I get to New Orleans.
