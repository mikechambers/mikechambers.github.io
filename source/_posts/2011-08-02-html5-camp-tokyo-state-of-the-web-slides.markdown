I am in Tokyo for the week and just spoke at the [Tokyo HTML5 Camp][1], giving a talk on some of the lessons learned from working on theexpressiveweb.com, and talking about Adobe and HTML. I have posted the slides with notes online.

<div style="text-align:center">
  <a href="/html5/presentations/state_of_the_web.pdf"><img src="/html5/presentations/state_of_the_web_title.png" width="500" height="281" style="border:1px solid black; moz-box-shadow: 3px 3px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.7);-webkit-box-shadow: 3px 3px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.7);box-shadow: 3px 3px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.7);" /></a>
</div>
