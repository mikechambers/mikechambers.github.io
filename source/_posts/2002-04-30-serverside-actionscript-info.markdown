There have been some questions about documentation and examples for ServerSide ActionScript (included with ColdFusion MX to be used with Flash Remoting). There are five chapters on ServerSide ActionScript (SSAS) included with CFMX, and they are available from the main doc page. If you are running CF MX as a standalone server, you can access the documentation [here][1]&nbsp;(if CFMX is running), and [here][2] (as a pdf).  
I have also put together a couple of simple examples of using ServerSide ActionScript

    You might also want to check out the [Rhino][3] documentation since that is what the SSAS is built upon.</p>
