We are running a [promotion][1] right now where if you buy Flash MX, Dreamweaver MX or Macromedia Studio MX Plus, you get free shipping. The first 500 people also get a $50 gift certificate from Amazon.

I usually don&#8217;t post promotion stuff like this, but the webpage for the site highlights some nice sites made with Macromedia MX products. The sites highlighted are the Volvo XC90, Sony Classical, and the Terminator3 site.

You can view the highlights as well as find more information on the promotion [here][1].
