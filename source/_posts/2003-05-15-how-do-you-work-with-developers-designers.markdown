When I am doing application development with Flash the work-flow usually consists of:

*   I spec out the app (with input from the design)
*   I develop the app.
*   Once the app is functioning, I pass it on to the designer to complete the UI and look and feel.
*   I make minor bug fixes and changes, but usually no UI changes

What is your work flow like? As a developer, when do you pass the work to the designer? Or if you are a designer, when do you start to work on the project?
