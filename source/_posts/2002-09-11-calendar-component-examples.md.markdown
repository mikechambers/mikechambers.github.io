Some developers are having&nbsp;problems understanding how the Calendar component works ([thread][1]), so i put together a couple of simple examples that show how to use the component.  
The first example shows how to work with a single selected date, and the second shows how to work with multiple selected dates.  
You can download the files [here][2].  
If you know of any other examples online, please post them in the comments.
