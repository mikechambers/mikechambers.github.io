I was playing around on the newly designed [DevNet Center][1] this weekend and came across the [Video Tip of the Week Archive][2]. I knew that we had a video tip of the week, but I didn&#8217;t realize how extensive it was. The archive has a ton of short video tutorials on topics covering most of our products. There are quite a few on Flash MX including:

*   [Macromedia Flash Remoting with JRun][3]
*   [Getting Started with Macromedia Flash Remoting][4]
*   [Loading Images Dynamically in Flash MX][5]
*   [Adding a Video Controller for Macromedia Flash MX][6]
*   [SQueeze Your Video for Macromedia Flash MX][7]
*   [Skinning Components in Macromedia Flash MX][8]
*   [Build Better Forms with Flash MX][9]
*   [A Better Customer Cursor for Flash MX][10]
*   [Fading Sounds Under ActionScript][11]
*   [Printing from Macromedia Flash MX][12]
*   [Function Basics for Macromedia Flash][13]
*   [Macromedia Flash and QuickTime Integration][14]

You can view a complete list of all of the the Video Tips of the Week [here][2].
