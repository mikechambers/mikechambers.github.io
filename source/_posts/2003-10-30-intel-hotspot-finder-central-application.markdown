I just noticed that Intel has released a Macromedia [Central][1] version of their [HotSpot finder][2]. This is a very cool application that will show you all of the Wireless hotspots in your area. Even cooler is that it will cache your results so you can view them offline (when you need a hotspot finder the most!).

You can install the Hostspot finder from the bottom of this [page][2].
