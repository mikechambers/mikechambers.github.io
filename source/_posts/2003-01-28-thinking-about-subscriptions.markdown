I have been meaning to post this for a while, but haven&#8217;t had a chance until now. Since we launched the [Developer Resource Kit ][1](DRK) about 5 months ago, I have seen a number of [posts][2] requesting that we make the DRKs available via some sort of subscription based service.

So, my question for the day is: what do you think of software subscriptions in general? What about a subscription to our tools? What would you want to see included? How would you want it implemented?

Update : note that I am not talking about DRK subscriptions (or at least not that specifically), but subscriptions in general.

Post your thoughts in the comments section...
