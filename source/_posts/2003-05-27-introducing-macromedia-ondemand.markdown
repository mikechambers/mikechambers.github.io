We just launched a new section of our website titled [ondemand][1]. The section features demos and seminars geared toward users evaluating our products. These are useful for quickly learning about products that you may not be as familiar with, or to learn some new functionality in products that you use every day.

I am really excited about these seminar, as I think they have enormous potential for making the learning curve for learning new tools and software much shorter.

You can view the site [here][1].
