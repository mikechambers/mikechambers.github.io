The new [ColdFusion MX updater][1] provides the options to disable access to web services from Flash via Flash Remoting. From the [release notes][2]:

Access to webservices are **disabled** by default in updater 3, so if you are calling them from Flash via Flash Remoting, you will need to enabled them.
