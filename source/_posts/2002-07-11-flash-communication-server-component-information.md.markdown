We have put up a [page][1] with some information on the availability of the Flash Communication Server Components:  
*During the week of July 15, 2002, seven of the Communication Components for Macromedia Flash Communication Server MX will be available for download to all users, including trial users. In early August, additional components will be made available to registered users.*  
Note that these are not necessary to author content for the Flash Communication Server (they just make some things easier).
