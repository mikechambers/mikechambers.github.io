I just had my introduction to [Central session][1] at [MXDU][2], and aside from running into a problem where my preferences got corrupted (which kept Flash from running for about 10 minutes), everything went great.

Here are the links to resources that I mentioned during my session:

*   [Central Quick Start Guide][3]
*   [Install Central][4]
*   [Download Central SDK][5]
*   [Central Developer Center][5]
*   [Central Standalone Trace Panel (Windows)][6]
*   [Central Standalone Trace Panel (OS X)][7]
*   [Intel Hotspot Finder Central App (at bottom of page)][8]
*   [Central Developer Chat][9]

If I left anything out, just post it in the comments. (Btw, the conference is rocking).
