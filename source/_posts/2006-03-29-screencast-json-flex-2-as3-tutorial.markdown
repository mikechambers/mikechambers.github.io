I uploaded a [screencast][1] of me building the example that I put together in [yesterday&#8217;s JSON tutorial][2].

It is a simple example that shows how to use JSON serialized data within an ActionScript 3 / Flex 3 app.

You can read the entire tutorial [here][2].

You can view the screencast [here][1].
