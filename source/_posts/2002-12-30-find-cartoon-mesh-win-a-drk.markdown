<IMG src="/mesh/files/mike_chambers.gif" align=right>Things are still a little slow because of the holidays, so I thought I would reward regular readers of my weblog with a contest. Sometime this week, I am going to place Cartoon Mesh (see right) somewhere in a post on my weblog. The first person who finds him, and then posts the URL where he can be found in the comments section, will win a copy of the [Developer Resource Kit][1] Volume 2.  
If you are looking through some of the past pages / posts to find the image, and come across a particularly useful post, make sure to post it in the comments. It helps me determine what type of info you find useful for me to post, and it will allow me to put all of the&nbsp;entries in one post.
