Greg Burch has written a pretty comprehensive [tutorial][1] on extending the build in Flash MX components.  
You can read the article [here][1]. You can find a pretty comprehensive list of component resources [here][2].  
I posted this on Wednesday, but it got lost in the [avalanche][3] of articles and resources&nbsp;published by Macromedia on the same day.
