Vera Fleischer has [posted][1] some simple sample code that shows a basic Central application. Among other things, it demonstrates how to create a pod, agent and application, how to use [LCService][2] to manage communications, how to manage pods, and how to Blast data between applications.

This is a very good example providing all of the basics of a Central application.

You can view the post, and download the code [here][1].
