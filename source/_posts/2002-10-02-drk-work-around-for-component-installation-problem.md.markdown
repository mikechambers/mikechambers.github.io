We are getting a couple of reports of people having problems installing extensions / components from the [Developer Resource Kit][1] (DRK). If you have a problem, there are two work arounds:  
  
1.  When the extension manager opens, save the extension to your hard-drive, and install it from there.
  
2.  Manually copy the extension from the CD to the hard-drive and then install.

  
Using one of the steps above should solve the problem.
