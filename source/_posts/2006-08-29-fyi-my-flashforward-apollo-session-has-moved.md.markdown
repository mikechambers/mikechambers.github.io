Just a quick fyi, but the [Apollo session][1] that I am doing in a couple of weeks at FlashForward Austin has been moved from Thursday to Tuesday (right after the keynote).

You can find the listing [here][1], as well as view the entire conference schedule [here][2].

It looks like this is shaping up to be another classic FlashForward, so if you haven&#8217;t [registered][3] yet, hurry and do so before it is too late.

Christian Cantrell is also doing [a session on Apollo][4], so there is pleny of Apollo love to go around.
