I have just uploaded the 1.0 version of the Stand-alone Central Trace Panel for Mac OS X. This is a wrapper for the Central Trace panel included on the [Central SDK][1].

The Central Trace Panel includes the following features:

*   Ability to run the Panel outside of the Flash IDE.
*   Ability to set the panel to always be the top window.

You can download the application from [here][2].

You can download the source from [here][3].

You can download a windows version of the panel from [here][4].

Note, this is something that I worked on as a personal project, and is not supported by Macromedia. Use at your own risk.

Thanks to Andrew Borovsky for the awesome icon.
