We have posted information on the next version of Director,[ Director MX][1]. Among other things the new version sports the MX interface, as well as support for Flash 6 movies. (Thus moving between Flash and Director, is much, much easier now).  
It is a great solution if your project is just out of Flash&#8217;s reach.  
You can find more info [here][1].
