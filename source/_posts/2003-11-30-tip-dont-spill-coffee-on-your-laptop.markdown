Well, early Thursday morning, I accidentally spilled an entire cup of coffee onto my laptop. The computer immediately shut off, and after a day of drying in front of a fan, it will still not start up.

So, if you have sent me an email in the past week or so, and haven&#8217;t received a reply yet, it might take a little longer. 

Luckily, I had already ordered a new PowerBook last week (yes, I am finally make the switch), and thus should hopefully be back up and running soon. I should also be able to recover the data from the old hard drive, so I shouldnt loose any data (finders crossed).

Anyways, until then, I will use my trusty iMac (it&#8217;s so pretty!).
