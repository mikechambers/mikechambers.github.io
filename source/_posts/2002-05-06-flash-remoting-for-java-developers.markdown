ServerSide.com has an [article][1] on the Macromedia MX launch. However, I am not posting because of the article, but because of the comments posted from the Java community to the article. A lot of the developers seem to be trying to undestand where Flash fits in within a client / server architecture, and whether or not Flash is capable of being an application front end.  
Pay particular attention to the [comments][2] by Sean Neville (Macromedia engineer who works on Flash Remoting and Jrun). He gives some really good info on what exactly Flash Remoting is, and how Flash fits into a client / server architecture.
