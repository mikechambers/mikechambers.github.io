Well, as you probably know by now, we [announced the Flex 2.0 family of technologies][1] for developer applications for the Flash Platform. These included Flash Player 8.5, ActionScript 3, Flex Builder 2.0, Flex Framework 2.0 and Flex Enterprise services.

I am going to post more about the significance of what we announced early next week (think Flex Framework for everyone). In the meantime, [Mark Anders][2] and [Sho Kuwamoto][3] both have great posts on what we announced yesterday.

Kevin Lynch announced all of this during a session at the [Web 2.0 conference][4] in San Francisco yesterday. I took my video camera and recorded the entire presentation (around 15 minutes). You can view it in the page below via Flash Video, and I have also made it available as an mp4 video file (anyone want to make a torrent?). I also uploaded it to [google video][5].
