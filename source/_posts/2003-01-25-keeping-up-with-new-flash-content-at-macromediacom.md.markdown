We publish a ton of content on the [Macromedia Flash Support Center][1] and the [Macromedia Designer and Developer Center][2]. So much content, that it can be difficult to keep up with everything new.

I just noticed that the &#8220;[new technotes][3]&#8221; page also lists the most recent flash related articles from DesDev, so you can use that URL to always know what the latest Flash resources at Macromedia.com are.

You can view the page [here][3].
