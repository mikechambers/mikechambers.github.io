I just noticed that there are some [new Flash Remoting tutorials][1] on the ColdFusion Product page site. <!--StartFragment -->

  
  
*   Building a Database Query Application with Server-Side ActionScript
  
*   Building a News Application with ColdFusion Components and XML
  
*   Building a Mail-Enabled Macromedia Flash Application with CFML

  
You can view these tutorials [here][1].  
These were all written by Christian Cantrell who will be talking about Flash Remoting at [Flash Forward NYC][2] next month.
