Just a quick fyi, but I will be checking out the sessions at the [Web 2.0 conference][1] all day. We have a machine setup with [Apollo][2] at the Adobe booth, so if you want to check it out, or ask any questions, make sure to stop by (if you are lucky, we may still have some Apollo t-shirts and stickers to hand out).

More info [here][1].
