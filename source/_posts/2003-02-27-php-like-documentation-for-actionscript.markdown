[Yesterday][1] I asked about public bugbases, and got a pretty good response. However, half of the response ended up asking about [PHP like documentation][2] for ActionScript. The PHP docs essentially allow users to add comments and examples at the bottom of the documentation.

So, here is the question for today:

*Would you be interested in a PHP like documentation system for ActionScript? What features would you like for it to have?*

Btw, we have a [similar system][3] already setup for most of our servers and languages, including CFMX, Flash Remoting and JRun.

Post your thoughts, comments, suggestions in the comments section.
