Check this out. [showroom][1] is a free Polish language e-zine focused on Macromedia Studio and Flash. Two editions thus far, and they look like they contain some pretty good articles and content.

You can view both editions [here][1].

Btw, anyone know of any Macromedia focused Polish weblogs? We don&#8217;t have any [listed at MXNA][2]. If you have one, make sure to submit it [here][3].
