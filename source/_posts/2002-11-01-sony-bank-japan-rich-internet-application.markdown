I got a chance to meet up with some of the people from Macromedia Japan at DevCon this week. Among other things, the showed me the on-line [Sony Bank][1] which is done completely in Flash.  
You can view it [here][1]&nbsp;(in Japanese).  
This is pretty cool, but then they showed me the version where you can have little pets help you manage your account (i.e. they nag you if you haven&#8217;t saved enough money, etc). It is kind of like Hello Kitty meets JP Morgan.  
You can view this version of the bank [here][2]&nbsp;(in Japanese).
