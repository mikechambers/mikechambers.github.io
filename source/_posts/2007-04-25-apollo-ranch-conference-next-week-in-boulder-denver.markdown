Well, [Apollo Camp][1] was so much fun, we decided to do another. Adobe, along with creation chamber and xyleminteractive are putting on[ Apollo Ranch next week in Boulder Colorado][2] (not too far from Denver).

The event is:

Saturday night, May 5 at the Fiske Planetarium at the University of Colorado, Boulder

We have a complete line up of sessions covering Apollo and I will be giving the keynote. If you want to get up to speed on Apollo, or just hang out with a bunch of other developers, then make sure to sign up.

The conference is free, but the slots are being taken pretty quickly, so make sure to [register at the site][2].
