Just a quick note, but I have updated my [Wowhead launcher][1] to work with Adobe AIR 1.0.

This is a simple application that allows you to quickly launch searches into [wowhead.com][2] (for World of Warcraft). You can find more information, as well as grab the air file from the [Google Code project page][1].
