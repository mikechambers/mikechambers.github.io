Spike-Fu has some interesting [comentary][1] on Tim Bray&#8217;s curious [comments][2] about Flash.

*Johnny Script kiddie not knowing about stuff like that I can understand, but the director of web technologies at Sun should at least have some sort clue.*

You can read all of Spike&#8217;s comments [here][1].
