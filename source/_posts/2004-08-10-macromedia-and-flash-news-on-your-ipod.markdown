[Christian Cantrell][1] and I (mostly Christian) have updated the Macromedia XML News Aggreator ([MXNA][2]) with support for syncing with Apple iPods. The project, code-named &#8220;Take-Away&#8221; allows you to **read** and **listen** to the latest Macromedia community news (by category) on your iPod.

You can find more information on Take-Away (including how to sync it with your iPod) [here][3].
