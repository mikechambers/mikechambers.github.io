A couple of new articles have been posted to the [Central Developer Center][1] at Macromedia.com.

The first is an article that I wrote titled:

[Using the Central Accordion Tab Component][2]

which, as the title suggests, shows how to use the ever popular Accordion Tab component included on the [Central SDK][3].

The second article is written by [Ethan Malasky][4], and is titled:

[Using Notices in Macromedia Central][5]

This article discusses everything you need to know about using, sending and receiving notices in Macromedia Central.

So now you have something to read over the holidays.
