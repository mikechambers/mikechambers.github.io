A lot of people have had questions about whether you can use the Flex 2 Framework classes / controls (everything in mx.*) within an ActionScript 3 project without using any MXML.

You can definitely do this, and we have [posted some info][1] on the labs wiki that shows how (written by Gordon Smith).

You can view the info [here][1].

You can download Flex Builder 2 and ActionScript from [labs.macromedia.com][2].
