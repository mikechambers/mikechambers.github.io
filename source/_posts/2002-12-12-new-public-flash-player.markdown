We have [released][1] a new public version of the Flash Player for all platforms (Windows, Mac and Linux). The is the final version of the beta that has been running for a month or two.  
You can download the updated version [here][1].  
Note, this is also the first public release of the Flash 6 Player for Linux, and has full support for all Flash 6 capabilities (such as Flash Remoting, Video playback, Flash Communication Server, etc...). You can find links to the Linux players [here][2].  
You can find more info on this release, as well as download standalone, authoring and debug players [here][3].  
Note, unfortunately, due to some last minute show stopper issues on OSX and Linux, the version numbers are not synced up across platforms. Here are the release versions:  
**Windows / Mac Classic**: 6,0,65,0  
**Mac OSX** : 6,0,67,0  
**Linux**: 6,0,69,0  
We are taking steps to ensure this does not occur again.  
Finally, as [JD][4] pointed out, we have also linked to information about privacy and the Flash Player privacy settings at the bottom of the [download][1] page.
