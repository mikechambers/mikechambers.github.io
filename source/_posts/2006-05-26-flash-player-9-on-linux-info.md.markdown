Emmy Huang, Flash Player Product Manager, has posted [some updated info on her weblog about Flash Player 9 for Linux][1].

In short, we are actively working on Flash Player 9 for Linux, and plan to have a pre-release version up on labs before the end of the year, with final bits targeted at early 2007.
