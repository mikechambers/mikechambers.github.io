I have a small part in Monday&#8217;s keynote at DevCon, so I haven&#8217;t had a chance to meet up with many people yet. I have been able to talk to some other Macromedia people as well as see some of the stuff that we will be showing during the keynote.  
I think the general feeling is that developers understand MX and its advantages. Now we are at&nbsp;the point where we get to start to see some of the first true MX applications. This is when i think things get really exciting, and where the advantages of MX become apparent to more and more developers.  
Of course, I can&#8217;t talk about anything specific, but rest assured that a lot of them will be shown here. I&#8217;ll post info as it becomes available.
