We have just finished moving all of the [open source ActionScript 3 Libraries][1] over to Google code. Not only does this provide a much better infrastructure for the libraries (providing source control, mailing list, bug base, etc&#8230;), but more importantly, it finally makes it easy for us to allow other developers to contribute to the projects.

Here are the links to the new project pages:

*   [corelib][2] &#8211; General Utility classes and APIs
*   [FlexUnit][3] &#8211; Flex and ActionScript 3 Unit Testing framework.
*   [Flickr][4]- Flickr API
*   [RSS and Atom Libraries][5] &#8211; RSS and Atom Parsing APIs
*   [Odeo][6] &#8211; Odeo Podcast API
*   [YouTube][7] &#8211; YouTube Video API
*   [Mappr][8] &#8211; Mappr API

Note, the [original Labs page][1] still exists, although it now points to the individual projects on Google code. The old subversion repository on labs still exists, but is no longer being updated for these projects. We are keeping it around to provide revision history for the projects.

All of the projects contain complete access to source code, documentation, unit tests, wiki, bug base, and mailing list. If you are interested in contributing to any of the projects (code, testing, documentation), sign up to the appropriate project mailing list, and offer to help.

Thanks to [Darron Schall][9] and [Mike Potter][10] for helping making this happen, and of course, thanks to all of the authors of the libraries who have contributed them to the community.
