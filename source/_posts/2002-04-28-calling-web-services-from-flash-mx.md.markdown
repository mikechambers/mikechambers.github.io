There has been a lot of discussion within the [Flash Community][1] concerning calling web services from Macromedia Flash. This seems to have been prompted by [google][2]&nbsp;making available a web service[]() for their search engine.  
So i thought i would give a quick sneak peek of calling web services from Flash using [Flash Remoting][3]. The example linked below calls the [google web service][4] to do a search (i&#8217;ll let the code speak for itself).  
The example is commented. Post any questions / comments in the comments section.
