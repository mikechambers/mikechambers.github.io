[Flash Forward][1] is this week in New York City. I am heading up there tomorrow, and thus may not post much for a day or so.  
I am planning on blogging the conference and report on sessions, premieres, announcements (except some big ones), and anything else going on at the conference. I have created a new section, [FlashForward][2], where I will be posting everything from the conference.  
If there is anything in particular that you want to hear about or from, post your requests in the comments section, and i will see what i can do.
