We have just posted an update of the [pre-release version of Adobe AIR for Linux][1]. This version is a beta (previous version was an Alpha) and adds support for a ton of new AIR features (and fixes a lot of bugs). You can find all of the details in the [release notes][2].

You can find more information, as well as download the bits from the [Adobe AIR for Linux Beta labs page][1].
