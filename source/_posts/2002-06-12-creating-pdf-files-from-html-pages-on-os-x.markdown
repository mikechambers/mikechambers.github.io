I was putting together my speaker notes for my [Flash Forward session][1] on Flash Remoting, and I needed to distribute them in a format that would maintain the formatting and images. I normally would use Word or html to do this, but HTML requires multiple files and renders differently depending on the browser, and I don&#8217;t like to embed images within Word. I decided that PDF would be perfect for this, but I really had no experience with creating PDFs.  
Luckily, I came across [this post][2] from [whatdoiknow][3] which describes how to have [Mac OS X][4] generate PDFs from web pages. All i had to do was open Dreamweaver MX, type in my speaker notes, open them in a browser on OS X and save as PDF.  
Btw, this will work for any web page, and is a useful way to archive web documents that are useful. You can download the PDF version of the website [here][5].  
This isn&#8217;t directly related to Flash, but is so useful i thought that I would post it.
