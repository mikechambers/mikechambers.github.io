Apple announced yesterday that it is releasing a new browser named [Safari][1]. The browser has support for the Flash player (it uses the existing player already on the system). However, as some people have pointed out there are some significant issues with Flash playback within the browser. Since the Safari browser is currently in beta, this is to be expected.

We are working very closely with Apple and the Safari team to ensure that these issues are taken care of prior to the final release. If you discover any issues with Flash playback within Safari, please submit them to us using the Flash Player wish list [form][2], and also make sure to submit them to Apple using the built in bug reporting feature (click on the little bug at the top right of the browser).
