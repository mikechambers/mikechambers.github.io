Flash Update (7.2 / Ellipsis) is Available

The second update to Flash MX 2004 is now [avaliable][1] from macromedia.com. This brings Flash up to version 7.2, and focuses on a number of areas:

*   Performance / Stability / Resource Usage
*   Usability / Annoying Bugs
*   Components
*   Documentations

In total, over 120 bugs were fixed.

I have written an [article][2] that discusses Ellipsis, some of the issues that caused us to need to do two updates to Flash, as well as changes at Macromedia to help ensure we don&#8217;t make the same mistakes again.

[What is the Significance of Ellipsis?][2]

In addition, we have a bunch of new articles on the DevNet Center with information about Ellipsis:

*   [Flash MX 2004 Documentation : Responding to Users][3]
*   [Introducing the JavaScript Flash File API][4]
*   [Using the new mx.utils.EventDelegate Class][5]
*   [Skinning Flash MX 2004 Components][6]

Note : Before you install Ellipsis, **[READ THE RELEASE NOTES][7]**. This will help ensure that you don&#8217;t run into any issues when updating.

You can also find a complete list of issues fixed in Ellipsis in the [release notes][7].

You can find more information, as well as download Ellipsis from [here][1].

I will be posting more through out the next couple of days with more information on Ellipsis.
