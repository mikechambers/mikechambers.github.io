The [Java Developer&#8217;s Journal][1] has posted an interview with Jeremy Allaire discussing ColdFusion MX, JRun 4 and Rich Internet Applications.  
In response to question asking about Java on the client side and Flash Jeremy responds:  
*I don&#8217;t think Macromedia Flash has grown popular because of Java applets failure, but rather because of it&#8217;s own inherent benefits &#8212; an approachable scripting and design environment; a powerful and capable object model; strong built-in support for remote communication and back-end integration; very small, lightweight distribution of the runtime, and the ability to design very small, lightweight client applications because of its vector-based design, and finally the phenomenal ubiquity across pretty much every major browser, operating system and device platform.*
