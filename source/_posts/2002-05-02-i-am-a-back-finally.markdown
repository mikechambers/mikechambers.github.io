Well, after 24 hours, we are finally back up. [Radio][1] had some serious problems which knocked the site offline for a while, and then prevented me from updating it. I am looking for some alternative hosting solutions, so we may be moving soon.  
Yesterday, Jeremy Allaire responded to some comments by Dave Winer. You can read Jeremy&#8217;s response [here][2].  
Btw, we released a new Flash player yesterday, read about it [here][3].  
Update : Big thanks to Dave and crew for all of the work they put in to get things back&nbsp;up. Dave, one suggestion though if this happens again, forget&nbsp;<!--StartFragment -->

[XML-RPC,][4] you need [duck tape][5].
