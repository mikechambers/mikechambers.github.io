We have started a [newsletter][1] at the Macromedia Designer and Developer [center][2]. The newsletter is sent out every two weeks, when we release new content on the Des / Dev center, and lists all of the new content.  
It is an excellent way to keep on top of the latest resources at Macromedia.com.  
You can find more information, and sign up for the newsletter [here][1].
