We have launched a new [Flash Remoting Application Development Center][1] on the Designer and Developer [Center][2]. As the name implies, the center contains tons of information, articles and other resources on using Flash Remoting with ColdFusion MX, Java and .NET servers.  
You can check out the center [here][1].  
This actually launched last week but&nbsp;i missed it. Sorry about that.
