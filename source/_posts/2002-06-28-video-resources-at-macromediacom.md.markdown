Today is kind of slow, so i thought i would highlight a couple of Flash MX video resources at macromedia.com.  
[Using Embedded Video in Flash MX : Robert Rheinhardt][1]  
[Using Video in Macromedia Flash MX][2]  
If you know of any other good video tutorials / resources, post them in the comments.
