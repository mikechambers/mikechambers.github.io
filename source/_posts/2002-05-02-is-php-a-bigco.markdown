Chris Heschong picked up on the conversation between [Jeremy Allaire][1] and [Dave Winer][2]. In response to Dave&#8217;s call that he wants MX to work with Radio, Chris [says][3]:  
*The fact is that it works pretty well with Radio. I can use Dreamweaver to manage all my content if I feel like it. I can have Fireworks MX create images automatically based on my navigatorLinks.xml file if I wanted to.*  
I have to agree with Chris on this. There are numerous ways that you can work with Radio and Macromedia MX products together. In fact, my page contains a simple example of integrating Radio with Macromedia Flash MX (notice the updated time in within the Flash movie at the top of the page). I will release a quick tutorial on this pretty soon.
