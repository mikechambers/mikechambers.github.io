Claus Wahlers has put up some performance [benchmarks][1] on string manipulation in the new Flash Player 6 [beta][2].  
The benchmarks show significant performance increases in string manipulations.  
You can view the benchmarks [here][1].  
You can find more info on the Flash Player beta [here][2].  
FYI : there have been some reports on [FlashCoders][3] of overall ActionScript performance increases of 10%.
