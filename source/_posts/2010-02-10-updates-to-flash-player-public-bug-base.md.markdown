You may have noticed that since September, the public [ Flash Platform (Flash Player, Flex, etc&#8230;) bug base][1] has required a login in order to browse and view bugs. This was not the case when we initially launched the public bug base but after a number of issues (primarily caused by spam), we had to disable viewing bugs without registration.

Starting last night, we are rolling out some new updates and tweaks to the bug base, and will be doing some testing to ensure that the original issues are addressed. As of right now, you can once again browse the Flash Platform bug base without registration (although logging issues or commenting still requires registration). Over the next couple of weeks, you may see some changes in access as we test and ensure everything is working, but the ultimate goal is to allow viewing and browsing of entries without requiring registration.
