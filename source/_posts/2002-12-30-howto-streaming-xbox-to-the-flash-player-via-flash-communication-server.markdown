Some time ago I had done a simple experiment with the Flash Communication Server and my Xbox. I broadcast myself playing SSX Tricky, and Halo to about 50 people via the Flash Communication Server and Flash player. I have had a couple of requests to explain my hardware setup, so here it is.  
It is actually pretty simple, and consisted of:  
**XBox &#8211;> (RCA Cable) &#8211;> Sony Mini DV &#8211;> (firewire) &#8211;> Mac iMac &#8212; > Flash Player**  
The Flash Player recognizes the Mini DV as a camera and uses it like a webcam.  
I set the Mini DV to VCR and then just started playing the XBox. The Mini DV basically acts as a bridge between the XBox and Flash player.
