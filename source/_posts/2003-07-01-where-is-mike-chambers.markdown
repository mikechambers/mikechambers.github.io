Sorry for the slow down in posting activity over the past couple of weeks. I have been swamped wrapping up some projects (can you say [DRK4][1]?), getting ready for [Flash Forward][2], learning some new stuff and selling my house (tons of fun!).

Anyways, things should get back to normal soon. I will also be at FlashForward next week, and I am looking forward to seeing everyone.

FYI, this Friday is a holiday in the US, so Macromedia offices will be closed. It might take a little longer than normal for me to respond to any emails.
