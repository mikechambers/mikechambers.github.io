This will be old news for some, but it is so useful i thought i would post it here. If you need some JavaScript code to do Flash player version detection, check out the the [Moock FPI][1] (Flash Player Inspector) that [Colin Moock][2] has put together. This is the best JavaScript Flash detection code I have seen.

Note : I am planning to integrate it into my site, but had some problems with [Radio][3] inserting HTML markup into my JavaScript. If anyone has any solutions, post them in the comments.
 
Update : [Dave Winer][4] sent me this [link][5], which describes how to fix the problem with Radio inserting HTML markup whenever it see JavaScript comments.
