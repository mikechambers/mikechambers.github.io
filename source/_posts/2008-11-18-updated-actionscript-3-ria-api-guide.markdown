We have just posted an updated PDF of the [Flash Platform ActionScript 3 RIA API Guide][1]. The new guide includes updated apis for Adobe AIR 1.5, Flex 3.2 and Flash Player 10.  
<!--more-->

  
You can find more information on the guide, as well as [download the PDF from the developer center][1].

You can view some images of the previous guide [here][2].

We also have printed versions of the guide. If you are [MAX][3], you can find one in your goodie bag. If you are not at max, I will be sending some guides and [new eboy sticker sheets][4] next week. Watch my [twitter account][4] for more info on how to get one.
