Here are my slides from my FITC Amsterdam talk titled [Building High Performance iPhone Applications with ActionScript 3][1].

Sorry I ran a little short of time, but you can find all of the info in the slides.

Here is the link to the [Simple Game Framework][2] which I discussed during the session.
