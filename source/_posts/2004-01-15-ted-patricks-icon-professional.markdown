Ted Patrick has been [posting][1] some icon&#8217;s created with his Central based Icon Pro application (currently in Alpha). Pretty cool stuff. I just realized that he has also developed a format for saving the icons as ACSII.

Anyways, pretty cool stuff. You can check out the alpha of Icon Professional and Icon Explorer [here][2].
