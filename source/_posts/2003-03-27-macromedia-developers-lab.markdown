Just a quick reminder that Macromedia is running a developer&#8217;s lab during FlashForward. If you have any questions, suggestions or just want to meet some of the people from Macromedia and the Flash team, come down to the lab either today or tomorrow. It is located in the internet lab.

I will be there today from 4 to 5 pm. So if you get a chance, stop by and say hi.
