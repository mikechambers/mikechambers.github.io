I will be speaking at the [O&#8217;Reilly Emerging Technology Conference][1] tomorrow (Wednesday, May 15), so my updates over the next two days may be a little sparse.  
I will be speaking at 5:45 about \&#8221;Rich application development with web services and Macromedia MX\&#8221;. Here is the session dsecription:  
*In this session, Mike Chambers shows how to create rich applications by integrating Macromedia ColdFusion MX, Macromedia Flash MX and web services. He will show how to quickly create web services using Macromedia ColdFusion MX. Mike will then show how Macromedia Flash MX can be used to consume web services in order to create rich applications that can offer a better experience than traditional web applications.*  
So if you are at the conference, come by and say hi.
