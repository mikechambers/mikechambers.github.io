Just a quick note, but I update [turl][1] last night. turl is a command line tool for Mac OS X that uses online services to shorten urls. 

There are a couple of minor changes, but the main new feature is that I added support for bit.ly. Here are the changes:

*   Added support for bit.ly
*   Made bit.ly service default (urltea appears to be down / gone)
*   Add some error checking to make sure a URL is returned

You can download turl, and the source from [here][1].
