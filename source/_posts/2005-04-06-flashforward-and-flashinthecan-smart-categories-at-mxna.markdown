As you probably know, both [FlashForward][1] (San Francisco) and [FlashInTheCan][2] (Toronto) are this week. I&#8217;ll be at both, but for those who can&#8217;t attend, I have created a temporary [Flash Conferences Smart Category][3] at [MXNA][4], that allows you to keep up to all of the latests news and information from the conferences.

[Flash Conferences Smart Category][3]

If you don&#8217;t feel like visiting MXNA all of the time, then you can use the Flash Conferences Smart category [RSS feed][5] to keep up to date on everything.

Btw, I don&#8217;t have any sessions at either conference this year, but I will be helping out with the keynotes. I will be at FlashForward Today and Thursday, and in Toronto Friday &#8211; Monday, so make sure to say hi if you see me around.
