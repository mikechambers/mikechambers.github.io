On Friday, we [announced][1] a new product line, the [Developer Resource Kit][2]. It [contains][3] components, extensions, articles, samples applications and other resources (including a complete archive of the Designer and Developer Center).</TD>  
<TD vAlign=top>![][4] </TD></TABLE>  
Some of the new Flash MX content includes:  
  
*   DataGrid component (including 46 pages of documentation, and 6 usage examples).  
    *   Flash UI Component Set 3 (includes : Loading Box, Prompt Box, Advanced Message Box, ToolTip and ToolTip Lite).  
        *   Media Player Components  
            *   3 Sample Applications (that include resuable Flash / Flash Remoting APIs for sending an retrieving email as well as retrieving historical stock information).</UL>
              
            There are also some more articles, as well as Dreamweaver MX and ColdFusion MX content.  
            I wrote a logged in [article][5] with some more information on the DRK, as well as some of our motivations for creating the kit. You can read it [here][5].  
            You can also see some other coverage and comments on the DRK at:  
              
            *   [JDB Cyberspace][6]  
                *   [SWF News][7]  
                    *   [DanielDura.com][8]  
                        *   [FlashMagazine][9]</UL>
                          
                        Phillip Torrone has some interesting [comments][10] on selling components. Phillip has been pretty successful selling content for the Pocket PC, so it is worth a read.  
                        Btw, we are working on getting a list of the component features as well as some datagrid examples online.  
                        You can discuss the DRK in the [DRK forum][11].  
                        You can find more information on the DRK, as well as purchase it [here][2].</p>
