Couple of items relating to weblogs about Flash on devices.  
  
*   The authors of [Flash the Future][1] have set up a new [weblog focusing on Flash and Devices][2]. Cery nice resource, and has links to all of the other Flash / Device related weblogs.  
    *   Phillip Torrone has created a new site, [pocketpcmagic.com][3] which will focus on Pocket PC news and information. This will allow him to focus [flashenabled.com][4] solely on Flash on device news and information (and experiments).</UL>
      
    If you are looking for a book on Flash on devices, check out [Flash Enabled : Flash Design and Development for Devices][5] (i am a co-author), as well as the soon to be released [Flash the Future][6].</p>
