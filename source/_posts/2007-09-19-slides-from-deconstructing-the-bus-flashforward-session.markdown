I just finished up my presentation at FlashForward. It was titled [On the Road with Adobe AIR][1] and I took apart some of the AIR applications that we use on the bus to power the [online APIs][2].

I have [uploaded all of the slides and files][3] for the presentation to the bus tour&#8217;s subversion repository.
