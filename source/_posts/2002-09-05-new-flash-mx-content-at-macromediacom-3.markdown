We have a lot of new content at the Macromedia Designer and Developer [Center][1] today.  
This releases theme is security, and we are debuting the new:  
[Security Development Center][2]  
Here is the list of articles that should be of interest to Flash developers:  
  
*   [Blueprints and Foundations: Build a Macromedia Flash Application][3] : Branden Hall
  
*   [Logged In : Securing your Web Applications][4]
  
*   [JD&#8217;s Forum : How wide is your audience and how deep do you reach them?][5]
  
*   [Tip of the Week : Skinning components with Flash MX][6]
  
*   [Switching from PHP to ColdFusion][7]

  
We also now have links to all of the Macromedia weblogs from the [Desdev][1] center (bottom left).  
Finally, you can sign up for our [free DesDev newsletter][8] that is sent out whenever we have a new release, and lists all of the news resources on the site.
