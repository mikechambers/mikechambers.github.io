Today we announced [Macromedia DevNet Subscriptions][1]. There are two [levels][2] of DevNet subscriptions: DevNet Professional and DevNet Essentials. DevNet Essentials is a yearlong subscription to the DevNet Resource Kit (formerly [Developer Resource Kit][3]) and includes four DRKs a year. DevNet Pro is a software subscription service consisting of Macromedia MX tools, servers, and DevNet Essentials. Both levels include access to a personalized subscriber portal where you can manage your license(s) and download the latest software, servers, DRKs, and upgrades based on your subscription level. 

We have a ton of resource and information on DevNet Subscriptions:
