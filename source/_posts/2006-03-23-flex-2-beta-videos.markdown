I just noticed that we have uploaded some [new Videos of the Flex Builder and Flex Framework engineers][1], demonstrating some of the new features in the beta 2 Flex release on labs.

You can find all of the videos [here][1].

You can download the beta 2 bits of Flex Builder 2, Flex Framework, ActionScript 3 and Flash Player 8.5 from [here][2].
