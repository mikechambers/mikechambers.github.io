We have been having some internal discussions (and disagreements) over the past couple of weeks on when was the best time to add an Apollo section to [labs.adobe.com][1], and start populating it with information.

Well, while we were discussing it, [Ryan Stewart][2] took matters into his own hands. Leveraging the fact that labs is a wiki, he went ahead and created an [Apollo section on labs][3] and began to populate it with some links to articles / information on Apollo.

You can view the Apollo labs section [here][3].

You can see Ryan&#8217;s post talking about this [here][4].
