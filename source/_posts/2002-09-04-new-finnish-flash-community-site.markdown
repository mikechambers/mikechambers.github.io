I just noticed a new Finnish Flash Community site:  
  
*   [apukettio.com (url is different than the name).][1]

  
To be honest, I can&#8217;t read most of the content on there, but there is a lot, and it appears to be updated often.  
Btw, if you know of any other useful Flash Community sites not in English, then post them in comments section.  
Btw2, we have a lot of localized content on the [Designer and Developer Center][2]. Just choose your languages at the top of the page, under the menu.
