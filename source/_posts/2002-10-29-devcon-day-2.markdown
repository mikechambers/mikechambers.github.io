Today is the second day of DevCon. I have two sessions today so i have been swamped getting ready and haven&#8217;t had a chance to post much. Here are some links to DevCon posts from today:  
  
*   [John Dowdell][1] (lot of info on conversations he is having with developers).
  
*   [Video Blog : Morning Update / First Session][2]
  
*   [List of all video blogs from the conference][3]
  
*   [Security and the Macromedia Flash Player][4]

  
Btw, I still haven&#8217;t posted the [secret code word][2] that you can use to get a copy of the DRK. I will be posting that later today.
