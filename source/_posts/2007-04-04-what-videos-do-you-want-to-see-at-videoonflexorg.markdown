Well, [Ted Patrick][1] and I launched [video.onflex.org][2] a little over 3 weeks ago, and we are already nearing our twentieth video on the site. If you haven&#8217;t checked it out yet, make sure to [glance through some of the videos][2].

Anyways, we are nearing the end of our backlog of videos, and it looks like I have some time this Thursday and Friday to create some more videos, so:

**What Flex and / or Apollo videos you want to see on video.onflex.org? What do you want us to show? Who do you want us to interview?**

Let us know by posting your thoughts in the comments.
