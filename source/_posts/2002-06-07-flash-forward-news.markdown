The Flash Forward Film Festival finalists have been [announced][1]. Make sure to check them out and vote for your favorites.  
Also, there are only a few more days to get the early registration [discount][2].  
I am really looking forward to this Flash Forward as it is the first time in New York in a year, and the first since the economy has begun to turn around. Plus, if the past is any indicator, there will probably be some sneak peaks of cool new technologies.
