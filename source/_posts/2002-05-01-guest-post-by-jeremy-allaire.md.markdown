I was bummed to read Dave Winer&#8217;s [comments][1] about Macromedia&#8217;s position  
vis a vis &#8220;BigCo&#8217;s&#8221;.&nbsp; The two primary issues &#8212; the mass community of  
scripting-level developers, and Macromedia&#8217;s efforts around web services  
interoperability &#8212; actually underscore a philosophy that I think is  
shared by Macromedia and Dave, and which is actually quite the opposite  
of BigCo-obsessing.  
The point about scripting-level developers is simple:&nbsp; the vast majority  
of people building web applications are using scripting languages, not  
big enterprise architectures; a huge number are using VBScript/Jscript  
in ASP; lots of use ColdFusion; tons use PHP, some Perl, some Python,  
and on and on.&nbsp; This is a good thing.&nbsp; Scripting is pragmatic and  
cost-effective.&nbsp; Our mission with MX is to empower these people.&nbsp; I&#8217;m  
not sure how this is paying homage to BigCo&#8217;s.  
The second item, on my comments on working with Microsoft on web  
services interoperability was merely a matter of fact.&nbsp; Yes, people  
(unfortunately) equate web services with .NET, and its important as a  
vendor to convey support for the same standards Microsoft is supporting.  
However, it&#8217;s also worth noting that Microsoft has been incredibly  
active and supportive of efforts to drive interoperabiity, along with  
dozens of others in the community.&nbsp; The related comment was about our  
approach here, which is decidely not BigCo &#8212; we&#8217;ve been actively  
contributing to the [Apache Axis project][2], an open source platform for web  
services.&nbsp; We&#8217;re working with the community at large to help make this  
all a reality.
