I have uploaded some [screen shots of the Ascension mp3 Apollo application][1] that I (and Jeremy Clark) have been working on (and which we showed at Max).

This is a Flex / HTML based application that runs on top of Apollo. I plan on releasing this as an open source project (and actively manage it, once [Apollo][2] is up on labs).

I am going to try and post next week to show some of the Apollo specific code / apis being used in the app.
