I just uploaded a build of [Flump][1] (Flickr image downloader) that works with the [Linux alpha of Adobe AIR][2].

The issue was that the the Linux alpha is based on AIR 1.0, and I had packaged Flump as an AIR 1.1 app.

You can find more information, as well as download Flump (and its sourcecode) from the [Flump project page][1].
