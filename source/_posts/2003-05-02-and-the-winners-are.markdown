Wow. We were really blown away by the response to the [DRK ad spoof contest][1]. The creativity of some of the entries was simply amazing. So much so, that we decided to pick three winners instead of one. 

And the winners are (in no particular order):

*   [UI Correction Officer (Ben Gibbs)][2]
*   [Quality Control (Mike Klepper)][3]
*   [Mike&#8217;s Personal DRK (Anders Wikstrom)][4]

Each winner will receive a copy of the [DevNet Resource Kit Volume 3][5] (chocked full of component and sample app goodness).

Thanks for all of the great entries. We will probably being doing some similar contests in the future.
