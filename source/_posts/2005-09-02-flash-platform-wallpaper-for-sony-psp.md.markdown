I finally broke down and got a [Sony PSP][1]. It has version 2.0 of the firmware, so I can&#8217;t do all of the [cool things][2] with it (just yet). However, 2.0 does allow you to have custom wallpapers, so I put together a quick Flash Platform wallpaper for the PSP.

<img alt="flash_psp.jpg" src="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/mesh/mesh/files/flash_psp.jpg" width="480" height="272" />

Just right click to download it. If you want to make your own, the size is 480 x 272 (if you make one, place a link to it in the comments).

You can find info on how to load images onto your PSP [here][3].
