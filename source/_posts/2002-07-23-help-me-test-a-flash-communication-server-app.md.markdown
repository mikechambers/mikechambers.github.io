I am going to be testing a simple Flash Communication Server app on Wednesday (July 24) at 1pm est, and need some (a lot) of people to join to see how it handles the bandwidth. The app basically allows me to broadcast to everyone who is connected.  
First test has been done. You can read some info about it [here][1].  
In the meantime, I have put up a large version of my Flash Communication Server app. You can check it out [here][2].
