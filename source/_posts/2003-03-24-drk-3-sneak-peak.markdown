I had forgotten that this page was on-line, but [Waldo][1] pointed out today that we have a [page][2] on the website which describes some of the content planned for the next DevNet Resource Kit (DRK 3).

You can view the info [here][2].

I can&#8217;t give an more specifics on it, but I can say that it is only a sample of the content planned. Of course, [FlashForward][3] is going on this week, so there is no telling what new information may come out. (wink, wink, nudge, nudge).
