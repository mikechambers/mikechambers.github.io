Well, I have finally been able to catch my breath from the keynote (and from the lack of sleep over the past couple of days). Normally, I would give a blow by blow account of the Keynote, but after checking [MXNA][1], I noticed that there are quite a few people blogging the keynote live, including:

*   [Josh Dura][2]
*   [Greg Burch][3]
*   [RewindLife][4]
*   [Oscar Trelles][5]
*   [Christian Cantrell][6]

<!--more-->

  
The best way to keep up with everything is to check out the [Flash section of MXNA][7]. Right now, almost every item on there right now is related to info from FlashForward.

Highlights of the Keynote?

*   DRK 4 announced. Advanced Charting component set shown. Pollster online Polling Application. Will be available for in a couple of weeks.
*   [Breeze Live Announced][8]. Really cool Flash based presentation / meeting tool with support for screen sharing.
*   Performance numbers from the lab showing Mac performance in Flash up to 10 times faster.
*   Info on Royale
*   Another view from the lab, showing possible future features to authoring environment????

Make sure to check out the links above, as they contains a lot more details.

I have a bunch of pictures from the keynote, and as soon as I can borrow a PCMCIA adapter from Greg Burch, I will upload them here.
