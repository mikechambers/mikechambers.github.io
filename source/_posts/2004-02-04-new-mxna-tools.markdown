As [Christian][1] posted the other day, we have added some new [tools][2] to the Macromedia XML News Aggregator (MXNA). The new tools include:

*   A Web Service API
*   An ActionScript 2 Class to work with the Web Service API
*   A Macromedia Central Class to work with the Web Service API
*   OPML Feeds

You can find detailed information, as well as download the Flash libraries and examples from the [Tools page][2] at MXNA.

Here is a screenshot of the ActionScript 2 MXNAWebService API in the Flash Help Panel:

If you use the Web Service API, make sure to [let us know][3], and we will list it on the page.
