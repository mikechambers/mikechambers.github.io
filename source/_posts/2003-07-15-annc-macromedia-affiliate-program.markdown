We have just launched a new [affiliate program][1] that allows you to make money by referring sales from your website. This is similar to other affiliate programs, and allows you to make some money for stuff that you may already be doing (referring people to macromedia.com).

You can find more information on the program, as well as sign up at:  
<http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/sales/affiliates/>

Currently the program only applies to Contribute and Studio MX, but we will be adding more products in the future.
