Just a quick FYI. I am heading down to Orlando tonight for [DevCon][1] 2002. I plan on blogging the entire conference, similar to what I did for [FlashForward][2]. I have created a new section on the weblog specifically for DevCon which you can find [here][3].  
In addition to blogging sessions, we also plan to do some pretty cool things with the Flash Communication&nbsp;Server and the weblog. Stay tuned for more details. Furthermore, all of the other community managers will also be blogging the conference, so make sure to check out their weblogs through the week:  
  
*   [John Dowdell][1]
  
*   [ColdFusion][4]
  
*   [Dreamweaver][5]

  
If there is anything in particular you want info on, or anyone that you would like to be interviewed, post the requests in the comments section.
