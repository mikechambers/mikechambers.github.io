I am not sure when this went live, but&nbsp;just noticed that we have a new technote that lists and describes the [top 5 Flash MX topics][1]. Topics include Shared Objects, Local Connection, Unicode support and FS Command exec issues.  
These questions come up often within the community, so you might want to check them out and see if they address any problems you have been having.
