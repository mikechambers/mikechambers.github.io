We just released the final public [Release Candidate build beta][1] for the Flash Player 6.  
You can find more info, as well as download the beta [here][1].  
In order to qualify for one of the prizes (Studio MX, XBox, PS2), you must submit your bugs / issues by this Friday, December 6, 2002.  
We are particularly interested in testing of the following areas:<!--StartFragment -->

  
  
*   Shared objects
  
*   Text entry (particularly international text)
  
*   Local files and CD-based content
  
*   Movies using bitmaps
  
*   ActionScript intensive movies
  
*   Windowless Mode
  
*   Runtime Shared Libraries
  
*   ActionScript performance
  
*   Customization of HTTP headers 

  
Please, please, please take a little time and test your content. We are really trying to make this the most solid Flash player release ever.
