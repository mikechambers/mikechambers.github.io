[Peter Hall][1] (of [FlashCoders][2], and [Team MM][3] fame) has documented all of the undocumented methods and properties of the FUIComponentClass (the base class for all of Macromedia authored components). This can be very useful if you are developing your own components.  
You can view the documentation [here][4].
