I will be travelling to Europe next week for a couple of user group meetings and conferences. Ill be giving an update on the latest developments in the Flash world, and maybe even give a sneak peak or two about what is coming down the pike.

Here is the schedule:

May 25 : [Finnish Macromedia User Group meeting][1] in Vaasa, Finland

May 26 : [London Macromedia User Group][2] in London, England

May 28 / 29 : [Flash Festival Paris][3], Paris, France

I have got some cool stuff to show, so it should be a lot of fun. If you are in any of those cities, make sure to come out to the meetings.
