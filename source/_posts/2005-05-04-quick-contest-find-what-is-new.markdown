We just uploaded a mini release of the [Macromedia XML News Aggregator][1]. There are some cool new things in there, but instead of telling you what they are, [Christian][2] and I thought it would be fun to have a quick little contest.

So, the first 3 people to post in the comments describing one of the new features / changes to MXNA will win a [ Flash Timbuktu Messenger bag][3] (these are sweet). Make sure to include a URL pointing to the new feature / change, as well as your email address (so I can contact the winners). Once a feature / change has been posted in the comments it cannot be reused.

Btw, If you were one of the people that Christian and I pinged last night showing off some of the new features, then you are not eligible (sorry).

You can view the Macromedia XML News Aggregator (MXNA) [here][1].
