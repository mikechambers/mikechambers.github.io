I have been getting a bunch of email that the links to my [FlashCommand for OS X][1] download was no longer working. FlashComamnd is a command line tool written in python, that allows you to launch Flash authoring to compile FLAs.

Well, I found the files, and have re-uploaded them. You can find all of the information, including how to use and download the tool from [here][1].

<strike>I have not tested this with Flash CS3, so if it doesnt work, let me know on the [FlashCommand page][1]</strike>.

Update : After making the post, I just decided to create a google code project for it, which you can find [here][2]. If you run into any issues, then post an issue on the [project page][3].
