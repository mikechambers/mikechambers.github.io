[Director MX][1] is now available for purchase and download from our online [store][2].&nbsp; Among other things, Director MX includes support for OS X, as well as full support for Flash 6 content (including Flash Communication Server and Flash Remoting). If you are trying to create CD roms or other fixed media with Flash then you should definitely check it out.  
You can download a 30 day trial [here][3].  
We also launched the [Director MX Application Development Center][4] at the Macromedia Designer and Developer Center. There is a ton of new Director MX content and resources available, including quite a few articles on using Flash content within Director.  
Btw, sorry that I didn&#8217;t get this posted earlier, but I was traveling for work for the past week or so.
