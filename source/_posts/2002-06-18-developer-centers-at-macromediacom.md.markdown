Hopefully by now, most Flash developers are familiar with the Macromedia Flash Application Development [Center][1] at macromedia.com. However, we have a number of other developer centers that contain a lot of Flash related information. Here is a list of all of the current centers:  
  
*   [Flash MX Application Development Center][1]
  
*   [ColdFusion MX Application Development Center][2]
  
*   [Dreamweaver MX Application Development Center][3]
  
*   [Macromedia Studio MX Application Development Center][4]
  
*   [Macromedia Application Development Center for Java][5]

  
Keep your eyes on the [Designer and Developer Center][6] for new Application Development centers in the coming weeks and months.
