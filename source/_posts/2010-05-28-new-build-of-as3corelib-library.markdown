I have just posted a [new release (.93) of as3corelib][1]. The corelib project is an ActionScript 3 Library that contains a number of classes and utilities for working with ActionScript? 3. 

You can view a complete list of changes in the [change list (items 75 - 106)][2].

You can download the updated SWC and source from the [project's download page][1].

Thanks to [Christian Cantrell][3] for helping build the release.
