I don&#8217;t have much to post this morning, so I posted some ActionScript code that I created when I first started to play around with Flash MX. I have posted two things:  
[Config.as][1] &#8211; This is a class that can load and parse config files of various formats.  
[stringUtils.as][2] &#8211; This is a library that adds useful methods to the String object.  
Note, these are provided as is. Also, there is some weird stuff in there (look how I check that Config.as is included, I should just check for Config.prototype). If you have any comments, or suggestions, be sure to post them in the comments section for each piece of code.
