Well, I missed almost the entire first day of FlashForward. I was busy getting ready for the keynote. However, I did get to hang around a little at the end of the day, and ended up running into a bunch of [FlashEnabled][1] authors (Phillip Torrone, Christian Cantrell, Glenn Thomas, Billy Perry and Fred Sharples).

Sean Voisen has been blogging a couple of sessions from the conference, including:

*   [Wrapup on Deconstructing the Flash MX Video Player Part 1][2]
*   [Wrapup on Deconstructing the Flash MX Video Player][3]
*   [Live from FlashForward][4]

Ill be helping out with the keynote in the morning. There is some really cool stuff lined up. I can&#8217;t say exactly what it is, but think new product (and its not what you are thinking)!
