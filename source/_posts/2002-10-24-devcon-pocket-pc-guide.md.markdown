We have&nbsp;created a&nbsp;Flash based Pocket PC event guide for Macromedia [DevCon][1]. This has probably been online for a while, but I just noticed it.  
It is pretty nice, and really shows some of the power of Flash on devices.  
You can find more info, as well as download the guide [here][2].
