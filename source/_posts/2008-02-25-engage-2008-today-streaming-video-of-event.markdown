I am at the Adobe Engage 2008 event today in San Francisco. From Ted&#8217;s [blog][1]:

> Engage is Adobe&#8217;s annual conversation on the future of applications and the web. We&#8217;re bringing together key thought leaders and influencers to share perspectives from a broad spectrum of industries.
