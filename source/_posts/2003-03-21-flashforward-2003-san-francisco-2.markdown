I will be heading out to San Francisco next week for [FlashForward][1]. As usual, it is shaping up to be a great conference, and from what I hear it is already or just about sold out.

I can&#8217;t give any specifics (or hints), but the keynote should be very cool. Ill also be doing a session on Flash Remoting, and helping out in the [Macromedia Developers Lab][2].

Of course, as I have in the [past][3], I will also be blogging the conference as much as possible. I may even take my cam corder and take and post some video.

You can visit the FlashForward website [here][1].

If you are attending the conference make sure to say hi.
