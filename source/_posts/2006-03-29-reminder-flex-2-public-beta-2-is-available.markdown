I know this is old news for most, but I just wanted to make a quick post and remind everyone that [Flex 2 Public Beta 2 is available for download][1] on labs.  
This includes:

*   Flex Builder 2.0
*   Flash Player 8.5 (with ActionScript 3 support)
*   Flex Data Services
*   Flex Charting Components 2.0
*   Flex SDK 2.0 (includes Flex Framework, as well as command line compilers)
*   ColdFusion / Flex Framework connectivity pack

<!--more-->

  
One thing that I wanted to point out is that we now have an SDK only download of the Flex Framework and command line compilers (including MXMLC). We did this to make it easy for developers on Mac and Linux to start playing with the technology, without having to first jump through hoops. We will be releasing the final version of the SDK for free for both commercial and non-commercial development.

We have also released update builds of the [open source ActionScript 3 libraries][2].

Finally, we released a [new library called FABridge][3] that makes it easy to communicate between the Flex Framework and JavaScript.

Make sure to also check out the [beta 1 to beta 2 migration guide][4]. We did an API scrub between betas 1 and 2, so some of the API names have changed.

Check out this link to [find out more information on the Flex 2 Family of technologies][5].

So, if you haven&#8217;t already, make sure to [download the new builds][1] and check them out.
