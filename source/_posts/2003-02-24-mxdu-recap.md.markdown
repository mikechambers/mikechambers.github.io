Geoff Bowers has posted a [recap][1] of Branden Hall&#8217;s presentation at the recent MXDU. Branden basically showed the history of Flash from Future Splash to Flash MX.

You can view the recap [here][1].

Question of the day, would you be interested in seeing screen shots of every version of Flash?
