Peter Hall has put together a very cool [example][1] of the 3D Pie Chart component from the [Flash Charting Components Set 2][2] on [DRK 4][3].

He has used the extrude depth of the pie chart to display additional information, and has added some code so that the chart morphs between data sets.

You can check out the example [here][1].

You can find more information on the [Charting Component Set 2][2] here.
