Sho Kuwamoto has posted a [new Flex 2 component][1] that he has built that creates a sliding panel / drawer.

[<img src="/mesh/files/blogposts/DrawerDemo.png" title="""" width="250" height="198" border="0">][1]

The component is useful by itself, but it also shows one way to create a custom component in Flex 2.

You can find more information, as well as view the component and download the source from [here][1].
