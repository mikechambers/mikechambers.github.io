Rob Burgess is giving the [keynote][1] address at [Seybold 2003 San Francisco][2] tomorrow morning (September 9). If you are in the San Francisco area and would like to attend you can download a [free pass][3] for the keynote from the Macromedia website.

Should be pretty cool. I plan on being there so if you see me, stop by and say hi. 

You can find more information on Seybold [here][2].
