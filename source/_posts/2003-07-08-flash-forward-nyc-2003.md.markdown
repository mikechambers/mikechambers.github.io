I just arrived in NYC for FlashForward 2003. I am really looking forwarding to hanging around with everyone, and have already run into Greg Burch and Branden Hall.

I will be doing a small section during the keynote and then have an entire session where I am going to de-construct the [Google Search Application][1].

As in the past, I am going to try and blog the conference, so check back here for update (I will post all of the entries in the [Conferences][2] category).

Anyways, if you are at the conference and see me around, make sure to stop me and say hi.
