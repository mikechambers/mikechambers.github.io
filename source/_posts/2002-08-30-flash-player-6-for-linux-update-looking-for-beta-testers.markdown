There have been a lot of questions lately, about the availability of the Flash Player 6 for Linux. Well, as we have stated before, we are currently working on it.  
As we have been trying to do with all of our Flash Player releases, we are planning on having a public beta for the player. However before that, we will have a smaller, private beta. So, if you are interested in testing out the Flash Player 6 for Linux, send the following info:  
  
*   Name
*   Email Address 
*   Company 
*   Any URL to content you are interested in testing
*   Version of Linux you are running.
*   Browser version you use.
*   CPU
*   RAM</UL>
  
to : <beta_flashlinux@macromedia.com>  
We really need people who are going to bang on the player, and find any issues that might exist.  
I can&#8217;t give an ETA on the public beta, or final release, but I can say it is sooner rather than later.
