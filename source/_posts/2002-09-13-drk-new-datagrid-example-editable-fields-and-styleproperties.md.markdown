Fridays are usually slow, so i decided to put together another quick example of the datagrid component available on the Macromedia MX [Developer Resource Kit][1].  
You can view the new example [here][2].  
Among other features, the example shows off editable fields, and formatting via style properties.  
You can see the original example [here][3].  
Update 9/14 : I have updated the example to include an index column, and to show how to add a custom sort function.
