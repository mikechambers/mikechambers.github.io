Congratulations to [Eric Dolecki][1] for getting [site of the day][2] on Wednesday for the Central application that he put together for the Max conference.

I have been amazed by how many people I have seen using it at the conferences today, and after we updated the news, I must have had ten people come up to me at tell me &#8220;It told me there was new news!&#8221;.

Congrats Eric. Great job.
