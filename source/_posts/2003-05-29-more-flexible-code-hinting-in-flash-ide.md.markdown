[Daniel Dura][1] has just posted a great tip on how to get code hinting to work within the Flash IDE without having to use suffixes or prefixes on your variable names. It involves declaring the variable type in the comments before the variable.

Update : [Greg Burch][2] just told me that the hinting will be global, and not scoped to the specific variable. Just something to watch out for.

You can read the tip at [Daniel&#8217;s site][1].
