I am in Dusseldorf now for the [FlashForum Konferenze 2004][1]. I am really impressed by the conference, and all of the cool stuff I have seen thus far (both in the conference, and from talking to developers). 

Anyways, I gave a talk this morning on Architecting Flash Applications, and promised that I would post the links to some of the resources and URLs mentioned during my session. So, here they are:

*   [Macromedia XML News Aggregator (MXNA)][2]
*   [MXNA Sample Application Code][3]
*   [MXNA ActionScript 2 Web Service API][4]
*   [EventProxy Class (and good discussion on EventDispatcher)][5]
*   [EventDispatcher Resources (from Google)][6]
*   [Google / Internet Search Application (on DRK 4)][7]

You can also download my Flash Resource Manager from [here][8].

I will be speaking again tomorrow afternoon, talking about our vision and roadmap for the Flash platform and ecosystem.

Btw, I will post more on the user group meetings from this week a little later.
