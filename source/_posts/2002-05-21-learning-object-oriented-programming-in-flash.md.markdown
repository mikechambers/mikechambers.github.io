If you are interested in learning just about everything there is to know about how Object Oriented programming works in Flash MX, check out the first couple of chapter&#8217;s of Robin Debreuil&#8217;s online book &#8220;[Building Object-Oriented Applications in Flash 5][1]&#8220;.  
I think that this is one of the best resources for object oriented programing in Flash MX, along with Dave Yang&#8217;s [site][2].
