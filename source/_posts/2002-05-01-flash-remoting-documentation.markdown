Chapter 29 of &#8220;Developing Macromedia ColdFusion MX Applications with ColdFusion Markup Language&#8221; ([download pdf][1]&nbsp;/ [all CFMX docs][2]) contains documentation on using Flash Remoting with ColdFusion MX.  
Since we haven&#8217;t officially announced other versions of Flash Remoting, we don&#8217;t currently have any documentation publicly available on using Flash Remoting with non ColdFusion implementations. ([stay tuned.][3])  
Note : Make sure to read through the other posts here as i have put up a couple of examples of using Flash Remoting with [web services][4], [ColdFusion][5], and [ServerSide ActionScript][6].  
Finally, if you have a question on Flash Remoting, you can post them [here][7].  
Update : If you have installed the [Flash Remoting Components][8], you can also access the documentation from within Flash MX via (Help > Welcome to Flash Remoting) and (Window > Reference).
