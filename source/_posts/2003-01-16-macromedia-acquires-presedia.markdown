We just released a press release announcing that we have acquired Presedia.

From the press release:

*Presedia Express enables non-technical professionals to use existing office productivity tools like Microsoft PowerPoint, annotate their presentations with audio, and combine these two elements into a streaming Macromedia Flash application delivered via a hosted or licensed solution.*

You can read the entire press release and find more information [here][1].

Presedia makes a tool that allows users to convert powerpoint slides into Flash applications / slides. Pretty cool. Now you can take advantages of the cross platform [availability][2] and [ubiquity][3] of the Flash player to ensure that all users can view your presentations and slides.
