[Digital Media Minute][1] just posted a link to the [Regular Expression Library][2] which is a repository of Regular Expression expressions (currently with over 450 entries).

This is a useful resource if your are developing applications for [Central][3], as Central has built in support for regular expressions. Of course, it is also useful if you are using one of the community developed Flash regular expression [libraries][4].

You can view the website [here][2].

You can find some more information on Regular Expressions in Central [here][5] and [here][6].

Btw, we will be posting an extensive article on using Regular Expressions in Central on the [DevNet][3] center very soon.
