We have posted some changes related to Central and licensing at Macromedia.com. We have made some tweaks to the EULA to make it clearer what a commercial application is, and have updated the [FAQ][1] with about 20 new questions on licensing and other items.

Finally, you can now buy Central capacity packs in packs of 20 or 100. This significantly lowers the entry point for deploying Central applications internally.

Here are the links:

Thanks for everyone&#8217;s feedback and input.
