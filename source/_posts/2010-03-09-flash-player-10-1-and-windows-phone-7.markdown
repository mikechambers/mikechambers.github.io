There has been a lot of buzz in the mobile space lately, and I suspect there will be even more around [Windows Phone 7][1] at next week's [Microsoft Mix conference][2]. One thing I wanted to clarify as it may have been lost in some of the other news is that *Adobe and Microsoft are working together to bring Flash Player 10.1 to Internet Explorer Mobile on Windows Phone 7 Series*.

I don't have an eta or other specifics right now, but it is something that both Adobe and Microsoft are working closely together on.
