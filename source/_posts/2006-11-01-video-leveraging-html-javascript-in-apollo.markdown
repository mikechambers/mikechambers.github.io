I have posted a [video recording on the Leveraging HTML and JavaScript in Apollo][1] session from last weeks Adobe Max developer conference. This session is given by Chris Brichford, the engineer on the Apollo team doing the actual HTML integration, and goes into some detail on how HTML / JavaScript will be implemented within Apollo.

The session focuses a lot of HTML via Flash (since that is what we have implemented right now), but of course you will be able to build applications for Apollo entirely of HTML and JavaScript.

You can view the entire video [here][1].

You can find more information on Apollo [here][2].
