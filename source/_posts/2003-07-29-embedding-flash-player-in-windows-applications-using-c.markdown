The Macromedia DevNet center has just published an [article][1] I wrote that discusses embedding the Flash player within Windows applications using C#.

The article is based on the [Stock Charting Windows application][2] which is included on [DRK 4][3]. The application uses the line chart component from the [Flash Charting Component Set 2][4] to chart historical stock data within the windows app.

You can read the entire article [here][1].
