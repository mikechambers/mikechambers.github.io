I just noticed this in my referrer logs. I am not sure what the language is, but I am guessing that it is a [Russian language Flash weblog][1]. It looks like they are keeping up to date on the news, so if you read Russian (or whatever cyrillic language it is) check it out.  
You can view the page [here][1].
