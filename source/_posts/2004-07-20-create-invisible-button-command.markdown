Last week during customer visits, one of the customers commented that he is always creating invisible buttons. While I don&#8217;t create them much myself anymore, I used to use them all of the time, and though how it can be a little bit of a hassle / pain.

So, I create a simple JSFL Command that will automatically create an invisible button from whatever is selected on the stage.

You can download the command from [here][1].

Installation and usage info is included in the zip files.

Post any questions, suggestions or problems in the comments.
