[Kevin Lynch][1] has just launched a new weblog. Kevin is the Chief Software Architect at Macromedia and is responsible for a lot of the cool stuff that comes from Macromedia.

You can view his weblog [here][1].

This is definitely a site you want to check out to get an idea of some of the thoughts and ideas driving a lot of what is going on at Macromedia today.
