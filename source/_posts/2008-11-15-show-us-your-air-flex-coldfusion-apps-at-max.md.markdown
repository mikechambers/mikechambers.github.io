If you are working on an AIR app, and will be attending [MAX 2008][1] this week, make sure to stop by the booth to show us your app. We have a station setup called &#8220;Developer Spotlight&#8221; where you can come and show your app to AIR Team members and evangelists (as well as ask any questions you might have).

Anyone who comes by and shows us their app will get either a new ColdFusion or AIR tshirt (both created by [eboy][2]).

Ill be around Monday afternoon, but the booth will be staffed all of the time ([Ben Forta][3] is there on Tuesday afternoon).

See you at MAX.
