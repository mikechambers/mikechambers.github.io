We have launched a new Macromedia DevNet Center RSS feed. We still have the old feed, but it should be considered deprecated. If you are using the old feed you should switch over to the new RSS feed.

The new feed is an [RSS 1.0][1] feed, and has a lot more information than the old feed.

You can view the feed here:  
<http://www.macromedia.com/go/devnet_rss>

You can find more information on the feeds [here][2].

Btw, if you are curious, we use the [RSSify][3] application which will be available on DRK 3 to create the feed.
