Its that time again, the Macromedia Designer and Developer [Center][1] has been updated with new Flash MX content and Resources. While this is not the largest release we have had, I think that it has some of the coolest and most original content. Make sure to check out the Asteroids [article][1], and the character animation [article][2].
