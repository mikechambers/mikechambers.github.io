One of the ActionScript 3 libraries that I use in just about every project I work on is the [as3corelib library][1]. This is an ActionScript 3 library that contains a lot of useful APIs for working with AS3.

I am planning to do some more work the library this week. I spent the morning scrubbing and fixing some bugs, and plan to fix more issues, as well as generate new docs and a new SWC.

So, if you have any bugs, issues, or feature requests for the library, [please log them on the project site][2] as soon as possible.

If you have questions about the library, then check out the [as3corelib mailing list][3].
