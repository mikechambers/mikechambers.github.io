Sorry for the lack of posts lately. News has been slow, and I have been swamped (once again) with work (can you say DRK 4?).

Anyways, I have been doing a lot of programing and writing lately, which means that I have had a chance to listen to a lot of music. So, I am curious what the Flash community listens to when they are swamped with work and have Flash open 24/7.

So, what is playing in your headphones (or iPod, or 8-track, etc&#8230;). I have been listening to a lot of Chemical Brothers and Crystal Method lately (see bottom right).
