A new Macromedia MX site launched last week. [DevMX.com][1] is a resource site focusing on all Macromedia MX products. Aside from having a pretty sweet interface, there is already some good content online.  
You can check it out here.  
Btw, Todd Rafferty told me about this last week at DevCon but I didn&#8217;t get a chance to really check it out until now.
