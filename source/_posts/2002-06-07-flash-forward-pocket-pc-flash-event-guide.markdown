Eric Dolecki has put together a Flash based Pocket PC [event guide][1] for Flash Forward. This is sweeet, and includes the following features:<!--StartFragment -->

  
  
*   Launch the guide directly from the Start Menu.  
    *   Runs full-screen (240 x 320).  
        *   Surface streets and subway maps.  
            *   Venue/Dining Guide.  
                *   Attendees swag information.  
                    *   Session details, listed and accessible by day.  
                        *   Wireless Session & Event polling enabled</UL>
                          
                        It uses [Ant Assist mobile][2] to install it and allow it to work like a standalone Flash projector.  
                        This is a great example of some of the potential that Flash on the Pocket PC holds.</p>
