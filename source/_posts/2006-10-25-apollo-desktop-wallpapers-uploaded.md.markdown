Another quick fyi, but I just uploaded some [Apollo Desktop Wallpapers][1] that I created. You can grab them from the [Apollo Wiki on Labs][1].

These are the original PNGs with layers so you can edit them. I have also [uploaded some vector art][2] if you want to make your own wallpapers. (if you do, post them in the comments, maybe we will have another contest).

You can download the wallpapers from [here][1].
