I got an email this morning from someone asking me the best way to learn how to build applications with Flash MX. I thought I would post the response here.  
First I would recommend getting a copy of [ActionScript The Definitive Guide][1], by Colin Moock (O&#8217;Reilly). You don&#8217;t have to read the entire thing (although it won&#8217;t hurt), but it is an invaluable resource. (Also keep an eye out for Branden Hall&#8217;s and Sam Wan&#8217;s [book][2]).  
I would then check out the The [Flash MX Application Developer Center][3]. There are some great articles there, included one that goes through building an [Address book application][4].  
I would then spend a couple of days going over those resources, and trying to learn what is going on. If you are completely new to Flash (but not to programming), it will take you a day or two, but it shouldn&#8217;t be too big of a problem.  
I would then start building some apps, really small at first, and then larger and more complex. If you have any questions, i recommend that you ask on the&nbsp;[FlashCoders][5] lmail ist.  
If you have any other suggestions post them in the comments.
