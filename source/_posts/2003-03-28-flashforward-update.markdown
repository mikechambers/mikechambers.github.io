I am currently sitting in on [Phillip Torrone&#8217;s][1] session on devices. Phillip&#8217;s sessions are always a treat, and he is not disappointing today. I think he has already shown about 15 devices.

I had my session and QA this morning and they went well. Before the session, I got to meet [Sean Voisen][2], which was really cool. Last night I met and chatted with [Josh Dura][3] and [Daniel Dura][4]. We ended up talking about video games most of the time.

Anyways, meeting up and hanging around with people I know from the community is always my favorite part of FlashForward. If you are at the conference and see me around, stop me and say hi.
