Woah, i completely forgot about this. We are having a [contest][1] to win a new Apple [iMac][2] computer. All you have to do to enter is submit a tip about a Macromedia product. The more tips you enter, the more chances you have to win.  
Find more info [here][1].  
Note : apparently we haven&#8217;t received too many tips yet, so if you submit some tips you have a decent shot of winning.
