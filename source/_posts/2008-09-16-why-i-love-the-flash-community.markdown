Keith Peters nails it in his [interview with ActionScriptHero.org][1]:

> The Flash community is seriously one of the best parts of being into Flash. I mean, the tools are cool, and what you can do with them is cool, but the openness and willing to help and share and teach each other is really incredible. I&#8217;ve dabbled in some other technology groups and have seen people appalled when I dared ask them how they did something, like I was trying to steal their precious secrets. But in the Flash community, you ask someone how they did something, they&#8217;ll sit you down, buy you a beer, explain it in detail and email you the source code the next day.

Couldn&#8217;t have said it better myself.
