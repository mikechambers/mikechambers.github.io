In case you haven&#8217;t noticed, the Flash Team has launched a weblog:

[http://www.markme.com/flashteam/][1]

Mike Downey made a post with information on [why the team started the weblog][2].

Right now, we are going to be posting [information about Ellipsis][3] (an upcoming free update to Flash MX 2004).

We have already posted information about one of the issues addressed in Ellipsis:

[#87305 : Compile time degrades over time][4]

The ultimate goal of the weblog is to get more information out, sooner, and provide a way for the Flash Team to communicate directly with the community (and vice &#8211; versa).

You can view the weblog [here][1].
