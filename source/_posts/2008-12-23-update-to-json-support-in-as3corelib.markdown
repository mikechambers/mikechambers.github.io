[Darron Schall][1] has just checked in some changes and bug fixes to the JSON support in [as3corelib][2]. Among other things, Darron has [added a strict mode][1] which allows you to specify how strict of a conformance to the JSON spec you want the library to follow.  
<!--more-->

  
You can [read all of the details over on Darron&#8217;s blog][1]. As Darron notes, these are not in the build yet, so if you want to play around with the changes, you have to grab the source.

I will try and do a new build soon with some more JSON changes, as well as some new code contributed from the community.
