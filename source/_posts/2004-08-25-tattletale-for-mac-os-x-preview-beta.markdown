[Christian Cantrell][1] and I have been working on a mini project for making it easier to keep up with the latest news and information from Macromedia. The name of the application is called TattleTale, and we are releasing the OS X version for beta / preview today.

What is TattleTale? TattleTale is a simple application that makes it easy to keep up with the latest news and information from Macromedia. Here is a screenshot of the OS X version:

You can view a desktop screenshot with TattleTale running [here][2].

This is a Mac only version, and has only been tested on OS X 10.3. We will release a Windows version very soon.

You can download the preview / beta version of TattleTale for Mac OS X [here][3].

You can set TattleTale to automatically start on OS X by adding it to *System Preferences > Accounts > ACCOUNTNAME > Startup Items Tab*.

This application is not affiliated with, nor endorsed or supported by Macromedia. Use at your own risk.

If you run into any issues or have any suggestions, then please post them in the comments.
