I&#8217;ll be speaking tomorrow night at the San Francisco Macromedia User group [meeting][1]. I will be showing [Macromedia Central][2] and [Flash 2004][3] and answering any questions thrown at me.

I will also be brining a couple of [DRKs][4] to give away.

Josh Ulm from [ioresearch][5] will also be speaking, so it is definitely worth checking out.

The meeting is tomorrow night, 7 pm PST at the Macromedia HQ. You can find more info, including directions at the [SFMMUF][1] site.
