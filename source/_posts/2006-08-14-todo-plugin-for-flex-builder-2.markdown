One of the features that I really hoped would get into Flex Builder 2.0 was the ability to track todo items in my code. This didn&#8217;t make the cut for 2.0, but luckily Flex Builder is built on top of Eclipse, which is very extensible. [Sho][1] pointed me toward this [todo Flex Builder extension][2] built by Dirk Eisman, which does exactly what I need.

After installing the plugin, any comments that start with todo:

`//todo: need to implement this function`

will automatically get added to the task list. This makes it super simple to keep track of what needs to be done in your code.

You can find more information on the plugin, as well as download it from [here][2].
