I just noticed that we released a [technote][1] describing some undocumented methods of the MDialogBox component included with the [Central SDK][2].

The updated methods include:

*   MDialogBox.doOpen()
*   MDialogBox.setIsModal()
*   MDialogBox.doClose()
*   MDialogBox.configureModalDialog()

You can read the entire technote [here][1].

FYI, we are also writing a more extensive article for the [Central DevNet center][3] on how to use the component.
