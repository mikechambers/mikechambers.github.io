I just checked in some changes from Owen Van Dijk that enable upload support in the [Flickr ActionScript 3 library][1]. 

The changes have not been added to the release SWC yet, so if you want to use it, you need to grab the [source from subversion][2] and link to that.

You can find more information [here][3], and see the original bug report [here][4].

If you run into any issues, or have any questions, then either [log an issue][5], or post to the [mailing list][6].
