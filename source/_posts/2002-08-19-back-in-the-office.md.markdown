Sorry for the erratic updates last week. I was in San Francisco for the entire week (I normally work from home outside of Washington DC), and I was caught up in meetings all week.  
Thanks for all of the input in the what do you want in Flash [post][1]. I put it all together, and it was very useful.  
Anyways, I am back in the office now, and thus will be picking up the updates.
