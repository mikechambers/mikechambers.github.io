[eboy][1] has posted an [image of the Adobe AIR 1.0 Launch poster][2] which they created for Adobe.

Eboy also designed the launch tshirt which you can find [here][3].

I think these are the coolest pieces of schwag that we have ever done, and it was really cool getting to work with a group as talented (and cool) as eboy.

So, how do you get a shirt or poster? Well, they are limited edition, so it is not going to be easy. You can either attend one of the [Adobe user group][4] launch events or grab one at [FITC Amsterdam][5] (where we are giving them away). Other than that, the only way to get them is to attend one of the free [on AIR Tour events in Europe][6], where we will be giving a couple away at each stop.

I will post an image of the actual poster later today (and update this post).

You can find more info on [eboy][1] here.
