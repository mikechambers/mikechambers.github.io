Wow. Lots of stuff going on in the Central community the past couple of days. First of all, a new [Central community site][1] has launched. [CentralMX.com][1] already has a ton of information and news, and has plans for tutorials and forums.

Geoffrey Williams released a beta of his [Amazon application][2]. This is a very advanced app and you should definitely check it out. You can see screenshots [here][3] and [here][4].

Finally, Mike Lyda release a Central application called [FiRe][5], which is a find and replace utility. Check out the [page][5] as he has some good information on how he developed the app.

I expect that we will see a lot more of this type of stuff once we [release][6] the SDK. Stay tuned.
