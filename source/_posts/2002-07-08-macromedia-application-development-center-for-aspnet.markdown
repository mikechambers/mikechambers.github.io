We have launched a new development center for Macromedia tools and ASP.NET. The [Macromedia Application Development Center for ASP.NET][1] is similar to our [Java Development center][2], and contains article on using Flash and Dreamweaver with ASP.NET.  
Watch the [center][1] in the future for more ASP.NET and Flash information.
