I have just moved the [as3corelib][1] library over to GitHub (at the urging of [Darron Schall][2]). This should make the project a little easier to manage, and in particular, make it easier for developers to contribute patches, and for me to review and accept them.

All files, issues, source, and wiki pages have been moved from the old site to the new one. The old site is still up, but directs people to the new site, and will no longer be updated.

Make sure to update your bookmarks to:  
<https://github.com/mikechambers/as3corelib>

Thanks to Darron Schall who help with the transition.
