I am starting to see a lot of questions about the Flash Communication Server, so I thought I would post some good resources for getting your questions answered:  
  
*   [Flash Communication Server Mail List (run by Branden Hall)][1]  
    *   [Flash MX Backend Communications Web Forum at Ultrashock][2]</UL>
      
    If you know of any other community forums for the Flash Communication Server, post them in the comments.</p>
