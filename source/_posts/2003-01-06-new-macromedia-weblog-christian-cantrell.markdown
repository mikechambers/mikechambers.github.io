Christian Cantrell, the new Server Community Manager for Macromedia has just launched his weblog.  
You can view it [here][1].  
The weblog system is a temporary one that he put together (using [CFMX][2]) over the past couple of days (although, I think it is pretty impressive). We are working on a more permanent, long term solution.
