Well, now that I have finally sent out all of the books from the [Ajaxian post][1] (I ended up sending out nearly 400), I now have 100 Adobe [AS3 RIA Reference Guides][2] to send out.

As you can see from the picture, I will be sending these out and only have 100. <strike>If you would like one, send me your mailing info (the info will only be used to send out the guides).</strike>

You can find more info on the guides [here][2] and [here][3].

Update : Wow. That was fast. All of the guides are now gone. Everyone who got one should receive it in the next week or so.
