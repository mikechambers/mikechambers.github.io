I just noticed that Volwswagen has launched a new [section][1] of their site that has information on their new car models. Of particular interest, is the Touarage mini site, which is done using [Flash Player][2] 6.  
You can view the site [here][1].  
I have to admit, I am a Volkswagen junky, having had a total of 5 over my driving career (diesel rabbit (first car, slow and loud), vw fox (zippy, door handles fell off), vw jetta (backed into parking garage pylon), vw new beetle (hilary clinton rode in it), vw passat wagon (i&#8217;m getting old!)).
