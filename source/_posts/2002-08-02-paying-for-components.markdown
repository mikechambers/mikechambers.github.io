Guy Watson (aka FlashGuru, or is it the otherway around?)&nbsp;has started a [discussion][1] on charging for components. Very interesting read, and a topic that is sure to come up again and again as more advanced components are developed.  
You can read the post and comments [here][1].  
Opinion : When you consider the amount of work that goes into a well designed and built component, and the amount of time and money it can save you in multiple projects, I really have no problem paying for something that i need to use. But in return, i expect high quality product and documentation.
