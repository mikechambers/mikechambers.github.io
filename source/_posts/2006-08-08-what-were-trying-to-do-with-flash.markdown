> What we&#8217;re trying to do with Flash is create a feature-rich run time that&#8217;s consistent across all of the platforms. That&#8217;s something that has not been the reality for other web technologies. Browsers have not been consistent &#8212; even the Java Virtual Machine is rarely consistent on different platforms. For the past 10 years, we&#8217;ve been able to say, &#8216;Here is a technology and a set of tools that allow you to create content once, then deliver it to a wide variety of platforms and know that it&#8217;s going to work consistently.&#8217;
