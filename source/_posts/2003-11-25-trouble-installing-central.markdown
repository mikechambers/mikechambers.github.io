We have seen a couple of reports of people having problems installing Central. We are trying to track down the issue and fix it. So, if you have had trouble installing Central, please post in the comments section, with the following info:

*   Operating System
*   Operating System Language
*   Browser
*   [Flash Player Version][1]
*   CPU
*   Amount of Ram
*   Are you behind a firewall
*   Do you know which firewall it is?
*   When you click install, do you see *To install this application you must first install Central. Would you like to install it now?*
*   Did you have the beta version installed before?
*   Do you connect through a proxy?

Thanks for any information.
