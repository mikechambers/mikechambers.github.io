I know this is probably old news to some people, but the [LiveDocs][1] system at Macromedia.com has been updated with tons of new information (including improved [search][2]).

LiveDocs contains online documentation for a number of our products, and allows users to add comments to individual doc pages.

You can view LiveDocs [here][1].
