As [Christian mentioned][1], Firefox 1.5 was released today. Unfortunately, it seems to have broken the [Macromedia News Firefox extension][2].

Basically, if you click a link in the extension, it will prompt you to pick an app to handle the URL, and will then crash Firefox.

I am going to look into this, but it might take some time to isolate and / or work around the issue.
