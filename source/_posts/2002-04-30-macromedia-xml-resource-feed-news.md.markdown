Check out the new&nbsp; [DWTeam DesDev Dreamweaver MX extension][1]. It makes it ridiculously simple to add information from the [Macromedia XML Resource Feed][2] to web pages when creating them with Macromedia Dreamweaver MX. Simply open the panel, check the data you want to display, and&nbsp;you are done.  
I also wanted to point out the [Harnessing XML with Custom Tags or ColdFusion components][3] articles at the [ColdFusion MX Developers center][4]. This uses the Macromedia XML Resource feed to show how to manipulate XML in ColdFusion MX.  
Btw, there are still over two weeks to submit entries in the [Macromedia XML Resource Feed][5] contest. We have gotten some really cool entries thus far, but none that use ColdFusion MX.
