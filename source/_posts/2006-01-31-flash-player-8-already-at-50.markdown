As Emmy [posted][1], we have just released [new Flash Player penetration numbers][2].

Flash Player 8 can be viewed by around 50% of people online (45% US, 55% Canada and Europe). That is pretty amazing considering that the player was released just 5 months ago. This puts the player on course to reach 80% in well under a year from release.

You can view all of the stats [here][2].
