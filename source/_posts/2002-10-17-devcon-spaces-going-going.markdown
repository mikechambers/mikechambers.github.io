Just a quick FYI, if you are considering attending [DevCon][1] in two weeks in Orlando, then you might want to make your reservations very soon. The conference has just about sold out (as of Monday, we only had about 100 spaces left).  
You can find more info on this [here][1].  
I meant to post this the other day, but got caught up in the DesDev [release][2]&nbsp;(sorry for the delay).
