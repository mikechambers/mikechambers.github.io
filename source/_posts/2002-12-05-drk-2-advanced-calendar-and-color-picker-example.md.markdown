I have put up a simple [example][1] using the Advanced Calendar and Color Picker components. The components are part of the Flash UI Component Set 54which is available of volume 2 of the [Developer Resource Kit][2].  
You can view the example [here][1].  
I will try and get some additional examples up soon.
