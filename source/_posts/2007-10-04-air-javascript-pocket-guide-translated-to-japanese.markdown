I just got an email from Yasuhiro Tanaka letting me know that the crew over at [anthill.jp][1] (they do some amazing work) has posted a [Japanese translation of the Adobe AIR for JavaScript Developers Pocketguide][2].

You can find the entire translated text [here][2].

You can download the english version of the book [here][3].
