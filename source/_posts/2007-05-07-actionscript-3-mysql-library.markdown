One of the questions that comes up around Apollo is [whether it will have built in support for connecting directly to databases][1], such as MySQL. We are not building in native support for connecting directly to external databases, but it is possible for someone to write ActionScript libraries to connect directly to the database.

Well, Matt MacLean has been doing just that, and has released an [Alpha version of an ActionScript 3 library for connecting to and communicating directly with MySQL][2]. This could turn out to be a very useful library, especially if you are building Apollo applications that need to connect directly to locally installed databases.

You can find more information on the project, as well as download code and samples from [here][2].
