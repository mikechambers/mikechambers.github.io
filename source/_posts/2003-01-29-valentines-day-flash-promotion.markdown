We just started a [Valentine&#8217;s day Flash promotion][1]. If you buy Macromedia Flash, Dreamweaver or Fireworks, you get a free visual quick start guide, a month of training, and a free box of chocolates.

You can find more info [here][1].

Ok, so it is a little hokey, but who can turn down free chocolates!?! Plus, the FMA for the promotion on the [main site][2] is pretty cool (with some nice jazz playing).
