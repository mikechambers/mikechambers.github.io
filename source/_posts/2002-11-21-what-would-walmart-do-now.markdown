Chris Mac Gregor of [Flazoom][1] has written a pretty extensive [article][2] on Flash usability. As Chris describes it:  
*It serves as a compliment to the original *[*Wal-Mart article*][3]* and offers my latest thoughts on one of the most pressing questions that we need to ask ourselves about using Flash; when is it best for the user?*  
You can read the entire article [here][2].
