We have just posted updated betas for [Adobe AIR][1], [Flex 3 and Flex Builder][2] on labs.

Note that the Adobe AIR authoring extension for Flash CS3 has not out just yet. It will be released in the next couple of days, so make sure to watch labs for the bits.

You can find more information, as well as download all of the bits on [labs][3].
