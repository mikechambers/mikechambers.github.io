Just a quick update. I am sorry I haven&#8217;t been able to update much this week, but I have been swamped with some stuff here at Macromedia (details to follow shortly).  
I am off to Tokyo tomorrow for DevCon Japan. I should have internet access and will try to do some reports from DevCon. However, it might take me a little longer to get back to you if you send me an email.  
If you have any suggestions of places i should visit in Tokyo, post them in the comments section.
