[Josh][1] and [Daniel Dura][2] have released a sneak peak of their [super RSS Aggregator app in the making][3]. It is named FlogSpot, and currently has two main features. First, it is a great Flash weblog aggregator, on par with [Flog][4] and [Full as Goog][5]. Second, and the thing that really sets it apart, is that it is also a forum auto populated from the various RSS feeds. Pretty sweet.

They have hinted at some more features, but it is already pretty useful as is.

You can view the site [here][3].

You can view the forums [here][6].

My request? If someone posts a comment to the FlogSpot forum in response to one of my articles, use the [weblog xml-rpc api][7] to submit the comment to my site (or at a minimum do a track back ping).
