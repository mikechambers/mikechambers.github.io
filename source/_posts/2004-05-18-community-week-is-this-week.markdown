I am sorry I didn&#8217;t post this earlier, but Macromedia community week is going on all this week.

What is community week? From the website:

*Macromedia is celebrating our customer community by hosting a week-long series of customer-focused events. Participate in these free online presentations and Wednesday&#8217;s worldwide meeting to learn tips and tricks from Macromedia product teams and your peers.*

There are tons of daily and free chats and sessions, including a huge world wide user group meeting (which I have on good authority will contain a lot of sneak peaks).

You can find more information, including the schedules for the MacroChats and WorldWide user group meeting [here][1].
