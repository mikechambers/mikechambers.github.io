CNet has [posted a &#8220;High Impact&#8221; article about Apollo][1]. It is based on an interview with Kevin Lynch, and discusses our goals around Apollo.

From the article:

> Apollo is designed to give developers a way to create applications that can render Flash animations as well as HTML and Acrobat files (PDF). That approach preserves the benefits of the Web but allows room for programs that can&#8217;t be included now, Lynch said.

You can read the entire article [here][1].
