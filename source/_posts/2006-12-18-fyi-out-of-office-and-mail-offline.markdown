Just a quick FYI, but I am out of the office the next two weeks taking some vacation. Also, my mail client (Mac Mail), has decided to crash every time I open it which makes it a little difficult to check email.

So, the sum of the two is that I probably won&#8217;t have access to (or be checking) email until early January 2007.
