Christian Cantrell has [posted][1] a couple of examples showing how to use [Central&#8217;s][2] built in Regular Expression API.

Examples include matching:

*   A valid URL
*   The title tag from an HTML page
*   Alphanumeric Characters

You can view the entire post [here][1].

If you have any other good Regular Expression recipies, post them at Christian&#8217;s weblog.
