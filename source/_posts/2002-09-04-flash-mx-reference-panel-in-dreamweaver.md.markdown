I think I have posted this before, but there have been some requests for it lately, so here it is again:  
[Waldo Smeets][1] created a Dreamweaver MX panel that loads the [Flash MX Reference panel into Dreamweaver][2]. This is super useful if you are using Dreamweaver MX to edit external ActionScript files (which I have been doing more and more).  
You can find more info and download it [here][2].
