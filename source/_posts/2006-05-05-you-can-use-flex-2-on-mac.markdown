Just a quick reminder, that the Flex 2 Beta is available on Mac. Just grab the [Flex 2 SDK][1] , which contains the compiler and framework.

You can download the SDK from [here][1].

Sorry for the repeat post, but I keep seeing people indicating that they don&#8217;t know that the SDK is avaliable on Mac.
