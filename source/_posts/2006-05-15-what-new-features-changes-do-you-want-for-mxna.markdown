Well, it looks like we are finally going to do a new round of development on [MXNA][1]. We already have a long list of fixes and changes we are planning on doing (based on user feedback). We have some cool ideas, but before we get started, we want to hear from you.

So, what new features or changes to you want added to [MXNA][1]?
