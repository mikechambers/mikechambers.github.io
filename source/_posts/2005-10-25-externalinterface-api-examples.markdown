Just a quick FYI, but I just uploaded a couple of simple ExternalInterface API examples to [labs][1].

The ExternalInterface API allows for player / container communication (such as ActionScript / JavaScript communication).

I plan on uploading some more examples over the next couple of days.

Note, these are built with [ActionScript 3 and Flex 2][2], although the API is available in Flash 8.

You can view the examples [here][1].

You can download the Flex Builder 2 / ActionScript 3 Alphas from [here][2].
