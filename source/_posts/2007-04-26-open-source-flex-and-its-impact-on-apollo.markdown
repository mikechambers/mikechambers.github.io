Well, as I am sure you have heard by now, we [announced last night that we will be releasing the Flex Framework and SDK under the open source Mozilla Public License (MPL)][1]. I am not going to go into too much details on the announcement, as it is covered in depth everywhere else ([Ted Patrick has a post ][2]with a good over view and collection of links, and Robert Scoble has posted some videos about the news ([1][3] and [2][3])).

One of the things included as part of this announcement is that all of the Flex based [Apollo][4] components will also be open sourced, but that then begs the question, what about the rest of the content that will be included within the Apollo SDK. 

We haven&#8217;t announced any plans at this time to open source the Apollo SDK. We are still in our alpha / beta development stage, and thus we don&#8217;t even know for sure what all will be within the SDK. However, once we have a better picture of what the final SDK will include, then I don&#8217;t think it is unreasonable to expect that the Apollo SDK, or parts of it, will follow the same path of the Flex SDK, especially since they are so tightly integrated.

Expect to hear more on this over the next couple of months as the Apollo release begins to solidify.
