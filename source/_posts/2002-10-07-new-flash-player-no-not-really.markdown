A couple of people have noticed that there appears to be a new version of the Flash Player (6.0.50.0).&nbsp; However, this version only includes the debug, standalone and External (test movie) players.  
There is a technote listing the currently player versions which you can read [here][1]. From the technote:  
*Builds 6,0,47,0 and 6,0,50,0 are functionally identical.*  
I hope that clears things up.
