Lee has just [posted a video of the visit][5] on his blog.

I have always been a huge fan of eBoy&#8217;s work and art (best know for their pixel art). We worked with them to design the [Adobe AIR launch t-shirt][6] and [poster][7] (both of which have been very popular), and most recently, on [a new AIR tshirt][8] (which we gave out in Asia).

You can [view the entire video here][5]. You can [check out eBoy&#8217;s work on their site][4].
