O&#8217;Reilly is running an article by Colin Moock titled [What is a Flash Component?][1] It is a very good introduction to Flash MX components with plenty of links to other relevant resources.

Of course, Colin is the author of [ActionScript for Flash MX : The Definitive Guide][2], so you know that the article is worth looking at.
