We have chosen some winners for the [DRK 3 Ad spoof contest][1]. Yes, I said winners (plural). We had so many great submissions that we decided to give away 3 copies of [DRK 3][2]. We have picked two winners already, but want to let the community vote on the third winner from the runners up. 

Here are the candidates:

*   [Accordion Mike][3]
*   [Kung Fu][4]
*   [Mike&#8217;s Personal DRK][5]
*   [mesh Hair][6]

To vote, send an e-mail to <mesh@macromedia.com> with the name of the submission that you are voting for. Voting closes on April 30, 2003 at 11:59 PM EST.
