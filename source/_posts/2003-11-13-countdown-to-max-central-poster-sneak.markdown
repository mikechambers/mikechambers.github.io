We will be giving out some Central posters at the [MAX conference][1]. The posters are developer reference guides, and really look nice.

You can see a (small) sneak peak here:

We won&#8217;t have tubes for them, so if you are interested, make sure to bring one for the poster (or pick one up in Salt Lake City).
