We are about to start a beta for the Linux version of Flash Player 7. If you would like to be added to the beta, please send your name and email address to:

UPDATE : Thanks for all of the beta requests. We now have enough people for the current beta. I will post here if / when we expand the beta.

As far as an eta for a public release, I don&#8217;t have an exact date, but I can say it will be sooner rather than later.
