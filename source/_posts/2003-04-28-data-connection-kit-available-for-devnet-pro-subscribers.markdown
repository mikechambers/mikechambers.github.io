The Macromedia Flash MX [Data Connection kit][1] is now available for download for [DevNet Pro][2] subscribers. You can download it from your subscription portal.

Couple of notes:

*   This is windows only, so will only be available if you have a Windows DevNet Pro subscription.
*   The download is for the Macromedia Firefly components. You can download Flash Remoting separately from your subscription page
