We have added a [new category][1] dedicated to Macromedia Central to the Macromedia XML News Aggregator.

There are already quite a few feeds there, and with the [release of the SDK beta][2] today, you can expect there to be a lot of posts over the next couple of weeks.

You can view the Central section [here][1].
