Grant Skinner has released a [full featured spell check component for use in Flash, Flex and AIR applications][1]. This is pretty sweet, and pretty much does everything you would expect a spell check component to do. It really fills a gap in functionality within RIAs.

You can find more information on the component, as well as see it in action [here][1].
