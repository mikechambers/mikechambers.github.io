I just noticed that the Certified Macromedia Flash MX Developer exam is now [available][1]. The exam certifies that you have a baseline of knowledge about developing and programing with Macromedia Flash MX. While it by no means replaces real world experience, it can let potential employers know that you have a certain base skill level.  
Beside, getting certified gives you a good excuse to ask for a raise.  
You can find more info [here][1]. We also have a Macromedia Flash MX Designer Exam, which you can find info about [here][2].
