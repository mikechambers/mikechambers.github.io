I just got a an email telling me that registration for the [Amsterdam user group meeting][1] has be really high, and thus we have had to move the meeting to a new (and larger venue).

If you have already registered, make sure to check out the [new info][1] (and if you havent registered, then make sure to register on the [site][1]).

You can find more information on the entire [European User Group tour][2] (that [Lee Brimelow][3] and I are doing) on this [page][2].
