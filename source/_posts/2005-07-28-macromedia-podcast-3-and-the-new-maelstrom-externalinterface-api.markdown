We have just posted the [Third Macromedia Developer Relations podcast][1]. Lots of good stuff in there including an interview with Mike Williams (engineer from the Flash Player team) about Flash version detection, Christian on History Management in RIAs, and some info on the new ExternalInterface API in Flash Player 8 ([Maelstrom][2]).

As we discuss in the podcast, the new ExternalInterface API in malestrom replaces the functionality of the Flash / JavaScript Integration kit, and provides seamless Flash / JavaScript communication.

Features include:

*   Ability to pass multiple data types (not just strings)
*   Function calls are synchronous, so you can get return values.
*   Built into the player
*   Works in all modern browsers.

There is more info in the podcast, and I just posted some info on the [FlashCoders Wiki Flash 8 page][3].

You can find more information as well as download the latest podcast from [here][1].
