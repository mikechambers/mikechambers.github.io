The guys over at [pixelconsumption][1] have put together an excellent tutorial on how to add ActionScript support to [Xcode][2] on Mac OS X.

This is really sweet, and includes support for:

*   syntax-indexing
*   code-completion
*   projects
*   compilation

You can read the entire article [here][1].
