As you have surely already read, we announced [Adobe Flash CS4][1] today. I am not going to go into all of the details about what is in this release as you can find that on the website. However, I havent really used the authoring tool in some time (I barely picked up CS3), but I have really been enjoying CS4. It just feels like the Flash team nailed it this time around (Keith Peters has similar [sentiments][2]).
