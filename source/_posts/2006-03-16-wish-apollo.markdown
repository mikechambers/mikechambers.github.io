We announced this during the keynote at FlashForward, but I wanted to make sure everyone was aware of it.

We have created a wish-apollo mailing list to allow developers to submit ideas, feature requests, and bribes to the apollo team.

What is Apollo? Apollo is a cross platform / device runtime that will allow developers to deploy applications that leverage Flash, HTML and / or PDF to the desktop.

We are in the early stages, so now is the perfect time to send in your comments.
