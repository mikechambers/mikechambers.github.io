Phil Chung has updated his [Flash RSS viewer][1]. Among other features, you can now save and filter your favorite feeds, as well as add any .91 or .92&nbsp;RSS feed .  
Phil also mentions a lot of people that he got help from. A great example of the Flash Community [working][2] together to do some really cool stuff.
