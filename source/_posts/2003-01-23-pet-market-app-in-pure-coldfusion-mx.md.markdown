I missed this one, but [Christian Cantrell][1] just posted that we have released a ColdFusion only version of the Pet Market application.

You can find more information and download the code [here][2].

Looking over the article, the entire app was created with just 1,500 lines of CF code, compared to 3,500 in .NET and 14,000(!!!) in Java.

It should be pretty interesting to check out the code and interface and compare it to the [Flash based Pet Market application][3].
