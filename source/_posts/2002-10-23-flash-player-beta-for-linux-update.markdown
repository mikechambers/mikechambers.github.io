We have updated the Linux build of the current Flash Player Beta. You can download it [here][1]. The [release notes][2] describes some of the bug fixes in this build.  
We really need developers to test their existing content with the the current Windows, Mac and Linux players. We are getting a lot of input on the Linux beta but not on the other versions of the player. This is your chance to make sure that we are aware of any issues.
