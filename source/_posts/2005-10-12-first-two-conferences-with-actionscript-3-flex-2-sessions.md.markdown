If you are itching to get a head start on development with [Flex 2, Flex Builder, ActionScript 3 and Flash Player 8.5][1], make sure that you sign up for and attend either the Max conference next week, or Spark Europe in November (or go to both!). Both conferences will have tons of sessions on all of the new technologies. 

If you have questions and want to drill down deeper, there will be plenty of Macromedia people at both conferences.

You can find more info on Max [here][2]. Look for the sessions that say &#8220;Next Generation&#8221;.

You can find more info on Spark Europe [here][3] (they have just started posting their sessions).
