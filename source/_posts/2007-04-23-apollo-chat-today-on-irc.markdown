Well, it appears that [a lot of people are interested in an Apollo chat][1] via IRC, so I set up a room today if anyone want to chat, or ask questions about Apollo.

Server: irc.prison.net (efnet)  
room : #apollochat

I was hoping to get a room on freenet, but was having trouble registering the room, so for today, Ill hang around on efnet.

Ill be in and out, but if anyone wants to hang out and chat, then join up.

You can find information on [IRC at wikipedia][2].
