I have been getting a bunch of emails from people telling me they are working on an app for the [Flash / ColdFusion Halo 2 application contest][1], but that they won&#8217;t be ready for the deadline on Friday.

So, I have decided to extend the deadline 2 weeks, until Friday December 3.

Btw, I have seen some of the entries and they are awesome. It will be really cool once they are all released.

You can find more information on the contest [here][1].
