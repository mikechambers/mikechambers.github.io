Juts a quick FYI, my [session][1] title at [MAX][2] has changed to:

**Developing with the AOL Presence API in Macromedia Central**

And now, Ray Ryan, the AOL engineer who is building the SDK, is also presenting, showing a bunch of demos and codes / examples.

Here are the remaining Session Times:

*   Thursday, 4:00 pm Â– 5:00 pm
*   Friday, 11:30 am Â– 12:30 pm

Btw, we will be giving out copies of the [Central Developer Reference Poster][3] at all of the Central sessions, so stop by if you would like one.
