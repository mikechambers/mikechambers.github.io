I am in Brighton for [Flash on the Beach 2009][1] (amazing conference as usual). I gave a presentation on Adobe AIR yesterday, titled "[Advanced Desktop Development with Adobe AIR][2]", which went well. I covered how to accomplish and approach a number of development tasks when working with AIR, and also talked about a couple of new features that we are working on.

I have posted the slides for the session, which you can grab from [here][2].

You can find most of the libraries and code I discussed on the[ as3corelib library page][3] (look in the com.adobe.air package).

Marc Hibbins has notes on the session [here][4].
