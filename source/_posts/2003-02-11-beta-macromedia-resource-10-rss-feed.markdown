We are considering publishing an RSS resource feed along with our current [XML resource feed][1]. I have published a beta of the feed, and would appreciate any feedback on it. The current beta is [RSS 1.0][2] using the [Dublin Core][3] (dc) module.

Is this something that would be useful? Are there any bugs in the feed? Do you want any additional information? Have I formatted the date field correctly? Post you thoughts and suggestions in the comments.

You can access the feed [here][4].

Note, this is a beta, and thus the URL may change, or the feed may not work at times.
