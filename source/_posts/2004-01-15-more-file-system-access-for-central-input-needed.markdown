Thanks to everyone who provided their feedback in an earlier [post][1] on File system access within Macromedia Central. It was very useful.

We would like some additional input. Specifically, what type of things would you like to do if you had file system access? i.e. how would your application use file system access within Macromedia Central?

A good example might be : *I would allow users to upload reports from the Central application to the server (to be shared with other users)*.

Place your suggestions / thoughts in the comments.
