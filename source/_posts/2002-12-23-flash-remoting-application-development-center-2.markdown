I just noticed that we have a [Flash Remoting Application Development Center][1] at the Macromedia Designer and Developer [Center][2]. I may have mentioned this before, but we have so many resources online, I can&#8217;t remember which I have mentioned.  
You can visit the center [here][1].  
There are a ton of resources, including some fairly new ones.
