Some developers had [reported][1] that they were having problems installing Central. We think that we have fixed the issue (a web server configuration issue), and need to know if anyone is still having a problem.

So, if you could not install Central before, please try now (you can click the Dev Chat install to the right), and let us know if it worked.

If it doesn&#8217;t work, please post the info requested in the [post][1].
