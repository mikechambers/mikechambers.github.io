We have released an SDK that allows search engines / developers to parse SWF files and extract text and links. <!--StartFragment -->

  
*The Macromedia Flash Search Engine SDK provides a set of object and source code designed to convert a Flash file&#8217;s text and links into HTML for indexing. The SDK download contains a C++ application, documentation, and editable source code for system integration into your search engine.*  
You can find more information, and download the SDK [here][1].
