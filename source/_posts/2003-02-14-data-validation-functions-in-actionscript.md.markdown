[DRK 1][1] includes some ActionScript classes for sending and retrieving email via Flash Remoting. It also contains an EmailAddress class that represents a valid email address (its basically validates that the email address is in a valid format).

So, why am I talking about this? Because I am trying to figure out what other types of data or user input would be useful to have validation functions for?

Thus far I have thought of:

*   Email Address
*   Zip Code
*   Phone Number
*   Credit Card Number

If you can think of other useful items, post them in the comments.
