As you probably know by now by all of the posts in the community, Microsoft has released [Halo 2][1] for the Xbox this week. One of the things that is really cool is how they are linking online [stats][2] to the Bungie website, and even providing [RSS feeds][3] of data for individual user stats (for example, here is a [RSS feed of my Halo 2 online stats][4]). 

So, since since it looks like [a lot of people in the Flash community are playing Halo 2][5], I figured this would be the perfect opportunity for a new contest. So, here it is:  
<!--more-->

  
The contest is for the best application that uses game stat information from the Halo website. Here are the rules. The entry:

-Has to be a Flash and/or ColdFusion based application (Flex apps included)  
-Has to be based on dynamic data from the halo site (such as the player [RSS feeds][3])  
-Has to be deployed on a public website and be publicly accesible

The contest ends at 5PM PST (-8 UTC) on Friday, December 3 (Note, the deadline was extended 2 weeks to December 3). It is open to anyone, except Macromedia employee. Here are what the winners will get:

**-1st Place** : Flash Timbuktu Messenger bag (these rock!), Flash Hat, Flash T-shirt and assorted Flash books  
**-2nd Place** : Flash Hat, Flash T-shirt, and assorted Flash Books  
**-3rd Place** : Flash T-shirt and assorted Flash books

You can find information on the Halo 2 RSS user feeds [here][3] (scroll down to section 6.6).

Update [Nov 19, 2004] : Kevin Hoyt has posted some ColdFusion code for parsing the RSS feeds. You can find more info [here][6].
