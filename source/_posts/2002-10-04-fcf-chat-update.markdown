This is just a quick update on the FCF Chat project we [announced][1] the other day. We are currently making some changes to the code, and our plan is to make it work within the existing [Flash Communication Server Component architecture][2]. Once this is done, we plan to open up development to the community (hopefully very soon).  
We have loaded new code in the chat, and it should be much more stable now.  
You can view the chat [here][3].
