We have put up some new documents at the [Macromedia Flash Support center][1].  
  
*   <!--StartFragment -->&nbsp;
    
    <!-- #BeginEditable "content" --><SPAN class=heading1>
    
    [Unicode in Macromedia Flash MX][2]</SPAN>  
    *   <!--StartFragment -->&nbsp;<SPAN class=heading1>
        
        [Using video in Macromedia Flash MX][3]</SPAN> </UL>
      
    I know there has been a lot of confusion about Flash MX&#8217;s support of unicode. Hopefully this document will help clear things up.  
    btw, I shouldn&#8217;t be travelling any this week, so i should have more frequent updates to the site.</p>
