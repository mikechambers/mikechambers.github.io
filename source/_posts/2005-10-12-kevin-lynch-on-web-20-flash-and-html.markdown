Kevin Lynch has posted his [thoughts on Web 2.0, Flash and HTML][1]. He discusses a lot of the topics covered during his [Web 2.0 conference session][2] last week, and focuses on how Flash and HTML can be used together to build Web 2.0 applications, and provide an all around better user experience.

> This is not about Flash vs. HTML or Ajax. It&#8217;s using Flash + HTML with the Ajax approach to build Web 2.0 applications

I had posted on a similar topic last month, which you can find [here][3].
