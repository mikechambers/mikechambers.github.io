Just noticed this, but there is an [ActionScript 2 to ActionScript 3Migration reference][1] up on Labs.

This is a great reference to get an overview of some of the changes.

You can view the reference [here][1].

You can download the Flex Builder 2 alpha and start playing around with ActionScript 3 from [here][2].

Note that it looks like a huge document, but a lot of the changes are just APIs moving into a package (as part of the general API clean up).
