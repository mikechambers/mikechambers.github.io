Marcos Weskamp has put together a very cool [application][1] that monitors and reports on which tools / software he is using on his computer. It uses [Flash MX][2], [Screenweaver][3] and [Flash Communication server][4].

He then has a Flash movie on his [website][5] which keeps track of the results. Really cool stuff.

You can find more information [here][1].
