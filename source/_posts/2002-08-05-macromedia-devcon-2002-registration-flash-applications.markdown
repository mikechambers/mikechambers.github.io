Registration for [Macromedia DEVCON 2002][1] is now open. It is October 27 &#8211; 30 in Orlando Florida, and includes tons of sessions and other events. I will be there doing some sessions on advanced Flash Remoting and Security within Flash.  
Notice that you can register using HTML, or a [Flash Application][2]. There is also a Flash based Agenda Builder that you can use to help you plan your agenda for the conference.
