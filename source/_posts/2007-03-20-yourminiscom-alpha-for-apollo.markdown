Check it out. [yourminis.com][1] just launched a alpha version of yourminis for the desktop. This runs on top of [Apollo][2], and along with [Finetune][3], is a must have Apollo application.

Really good experience. I think the coolest thing about yourminis.com is that you can have the widget on your yourminis page, embedded in your own website via HTML, and now on your desktop, via Apollo.

I also just [posted the video for the yourminis session at Apollo Camp][4].

You can find more information [here][1].
