I was just looking through the Flash Communication Server [support center][1] and came across a couple of useful technotes that i wanted to highlight. So here they are:  
  
*   [Troubleshooting communications applications][2]
  
*   [Securing Macromedia Flash Communication Server][3]
  
*   [Flash Communication Server port connectivity survey][4]
  
*   [Information priority within the RTMP protocol][5]

  
Some useful information. As usual, its a good idea to periodically check the [support centers][6] for new technotes and information. It should also be the first place to look / search when you run into a problem.
