Sorry for the lack of updates lately, but I have been traveling quite a bit. I am currently in Europe making stops in Paris, Rome, Brussels and Brighton.

I will be speaking about Apollo at all stops, so if you are in the area, make sure to stop by the meetings. Here are the dates and links:

December 1 : Rome : [Italian User Group Meeting][1] (Day full of sessions)

December 2 : Brussels : [Belgium User Group Meeting][2]

December 4 : Brighton, England : [Flash on the Beach][3]

Mike Downey (aka Mike #2) is also here and will be giving sneaks on the next version of Flash Authoring at all of the meetings (two Mike&#8217;s for the price of one!).
