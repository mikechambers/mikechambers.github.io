[Slashdot][1] has an [interview][2] with Joe Clark on-line. There are a couple of questions which either directly or indirectly relate to Flash. The first question is actually a very good overview of different types of Flash content and how / whether it can be made accessible.  
You can read the entire interview [here][2].
