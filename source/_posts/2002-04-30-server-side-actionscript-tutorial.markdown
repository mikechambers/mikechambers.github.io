There is a new [tutorial on Server Side ActionScript][1] at Macromedia.com. Here is the description:<!--StartFragment -->

  
***Building a Database Query Application with Server-Side ActionScript**  
In this module, you can learn how to build an application that searches a database using parameters provided by the user and displays the results in a rich Macromedia Flash user interface. It demonstrates two key features of ColdFusion MX: the built-in Macromedia Flash Remoting service and new support for Server-side ActionScript.*  
This was written by [Christian Cantrell][2] who will be speaking about Flash Remoting at [FlashForward NYC][3].
