The Macromedia Central Forum has moved. The new location is:

NewsGroup  
[macromedia.central.prerelease_discussion][1]

WebForum  
<http://webforums.macromedia.com/central/>

This was done do to the number of people who were confused about the purpose of the forum (thinking it was a central place to bring all issues / questions).
