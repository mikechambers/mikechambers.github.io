There has been an interesting [thread][1] on Flash Coders over the past couple of days discussing whether the Flash Player should support dynamically loading GIFs and / or PNGs.

So, which would you prefer? If we could only add one format, would you prefer we add support for dynamically loading GIFs or dynamically loading PNGs? Why?

Post your thoughts in the comments.
