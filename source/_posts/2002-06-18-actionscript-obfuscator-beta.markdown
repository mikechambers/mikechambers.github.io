[Robin Debreuil][1] has [announced][2] a beta of Viewer Screwer, an ActionScript obfuscator .  
<!--StartFragment --><SPAN class=postbody>

*Viewer Screwer is an Actionscript Obfuscator &#8211; a program that takes your actionscript and scrambles it into something that can only be understood by a computer, not a person. You can scramble individual files, or multiple files that must work together.* </SPAN>  
<SPAN class=postbody>You can view the announcement [here][2], and post questions to the forum [here][3].</SPAN>  
<SPAN class=postbody>This could turn out to be very useful for Flash developers who want to protect their SWF code from prying eyes and hacking.</SPAN>
