Just a quick note, the Macromedia offices are closed this week, and technically I have the entire week off. However, I will try and sneak away every now and then to make some posts.  
So, what do i plan to do with all of my time off? I am reading up on writing shell scripts (pretty exciting, heh!), and will try to get some Xbox live gaming in (gamertag : mesh). I am also working on some pretty cool projects that should see the light of day one way or the other sometime in the future. Oh yeah, I am going to finally try to catch up on all of the posts on the [flashcoder&#8217;s][1] list from the past week.  
So what are you planning to do over the holidays? Post your plans in the comments section.  
Happy Holidays!
