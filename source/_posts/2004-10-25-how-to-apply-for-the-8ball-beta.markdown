There has been a lot of buzz over the weekend about the [video][1] Colin Moock posted from the Macromedia Flash conference in Tokyo. In it, Kevin Lynch demonstrates a couple of new features in the next version of the Flash Player (code named maelstrom).

Since then, I have received about 100 emails asking to be adding to the 8ball beta. So, if you would like to apply for the 8ball beta, just fill out this [form][2].

If / when you are accepted, you will receive an email. However, we are still early in the process, so it might be a while before you hear anything.
