Just a quick note. Sorry for the lack of updates, there are actually some pretty cool going on&#8217;s lately but I haven&#8217;t had a chance to keep up with them. I am in San Francisco this week (I normally work out of Washington DC) and am swamped with meetings (ugg).  
In the mean time, check out the Flash weblog links to the right. I will try and catch up on posts later tonight. I hope everyone is having a good holiday.
