We will be giving out the cool Macromedia rune buttons at the [MAX conference][1]. We will have buttons for almost all of our product runes.

I know that buttons seem like a pretty small thing to point out in a countdown to the conference. Does it mean that there is not much going on? Nope. Maybe it means that there is a ton of stuff going on that I just can&#8217;t post about yet&#8230; ;)

See you next week at the conference.
