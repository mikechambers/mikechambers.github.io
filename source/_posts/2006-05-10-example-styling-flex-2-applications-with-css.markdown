The Adobe Consulting team has been busy over at their [blog][1] this week. Not only have they updated their super useful [Flex Style explorer][2], but they also released a CSS [style sheet][3] that will make your Flex application look a lot like a Mac app.

*   [Flex Style Explorer for Flex 2][2]
*   [Mac OS-X Style for Flex 2][3]

Both require Flex 2 / Flash Player 9 Beta 3, which you can grab from [labs.][4]

You can find more info on styling Flex apps using CSS on [livedocs][5].
