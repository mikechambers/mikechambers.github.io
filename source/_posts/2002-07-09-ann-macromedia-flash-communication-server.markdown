It is finally here. You can find more information on the [product page][1], check out the [top 10 reasons to buy][2], read the [FAQ][3], [download the trial][4], talk about it on the [forum][5], [buy it][6], check out resources at the [Flash Communication Server MX Application Development Center][7], or at the [support center][8].  
I wrote this week&#8217;s [logged in][9] column, which discusses the different versions of the server and pricing and hosting options.  
Btw, we will be showing off the server tonight in NYC. You can find info about the event [here][10].
