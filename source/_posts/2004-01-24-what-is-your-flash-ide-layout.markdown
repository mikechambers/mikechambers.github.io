How do you use Flash? Specifically, how do you arrange the panels and timeline within Flash?

Here is the layout that I have been most comfortable with:

[<img alt="fl_layout_sm.gif" src="/mesh/files/fl_layout_sm.gif" width="500" height="334" border="0" />][1]  
[Click for full size][1]

(Thanks to [Kevin Lynch][2] who gave me the idea of making the timeline thinner and moving it to the side).

So how is your environment laid out? Describe it in the comments, or post links to screenshots.
